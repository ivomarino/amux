//! "You went idle with N uncommitted change(s)" — ported from Python
//! (AMUX-2638), with the one change that stops a known incident recurring.
//!
//! # The requirement, which is the whole reason this is a card
//!
//! Python derived "yours" from DIRTY-TREE MEMBERSHIP. Measured 2026-08-09: it
//! listed 11 files as mine to commit; I had touched NONE of them — they were a
//! peer's in-flight rust migration — while the staged-guard, asked the same
//! question at the same moment about the same files, answered foreign=4,
//! unclaimed=18, MINE=0. Two components, one question, opposite answers, and
//! the WRONG one was the one giving instructions. Followed literally it sweeps
//! a peer's work into your commit, which happened three times in one day
//! (762e06e, 325314d, 4bf767c).
//!
//! So ownership here comes from [`Ownership`], which is the staged-guard's
//! answer (`POST /api/git/staged-guard`, api/git_guard.rs) and nothing else.
//! `git status` supplies the LIST of dirty paths and no opinion about whose
//! they are. That split is enforced by the signature: [`build`] cannot see a
//! repo, so it cannot re-derive ownership even by accident.
//!
//! # Why a foreign file does not merely get filtered out
//!
//! It is named, loudly, with its owner. The recipient is about to run
//! `git add -A`; the useful thing is not silence about the peer's file, it is
//! "do not commit this one, it is theirs". Python learned that the hard way —
//! the branch was missing entirely and two sweeps (~93 and ~85 lines) followed.
//!
//! # Why `shared` is warned about rather than suppressed
//!
//! On a repo where two lanes routinely touch one file, "both edited it" is
//! satisfied almost always, so suppressing on `shared` would silence the nudge
//! permanently. Name the file as contested and say who else is in it; the
//! recipient can then stage per-hunk instead of per-file.
