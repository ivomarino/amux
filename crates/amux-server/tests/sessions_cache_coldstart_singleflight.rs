//! AR-135's single-flight guard on `legacy_sessions_array` only ever covered the
//! WARM path (TTL expired, cache non-empty). A COLD cache — true on every
//! restart — hit `try_lock`'s `Err` arm, found `c.json` empty, and fell through
//! to an INDEPENDENT build: one per concurrent caller, each holding a pooled
//! read connection across ~100 tmux/git subprocesses at once. That is the exact
//! N-builders-one-pool failure AR-135 exists to prevent, just gated on "cache
//! empty" instead of "TTL expired" — and worse, because a restart is exactly
//! when every dashboard/fleet client reconnects and hits this endpoint at once.
//!
//! FIRST FIX (2026-09-09 morning): a loser on a cold cache waits (bounded 3s)
//! for the in-flight build instead of racing it, falling back to an
//! independent build past the deadline. Confirmed live the SAME day,
//! afternoon: that bound alone does not bound the builder COUNT. Under
//! SUSTAINED reconnect pressure (not one instantaneous burst — the real shape
//! of a restart), every new wave of waiters can independently miss the same
//! 3s deadline and each spin up its own build, stacking faster than any of
//! them finish. read_pool_exhausted recurred in bursts for minutes; box load
//! average hit 62 on 4 cores; amux-server-rs itself sat at 400%+ CPU.
//!
//! FINAL FIX: permit exactly ONE builder. A fallback that performs the same
//! expensive fleet scrape against the same tmux server cannot rescue a slow
//! primary; it makes the shared substrate slower. Waiters serve the last
//! structurally safe snapshot, or wait up to the configured deadline on a
//! truly cold start, then fail safely instead of starting duplicate work.
//! The builder also uses a dedicated read-only SQLite connection so it cannot
//! starve cheap board requests of request-pool readers while probing tmux/git.
//!
//! Asserted on the SOURCE, matching this file's sibling
//! `sessions_list_off_runtime.rs`: a timing test for "did the stampede
//! collapse under sustained load" needs a controllable hang across ~100
//! subprocesses sustained over many seconds and would be the flakiest thing
//! in the suite. The property that regressed both times was textual — the
//! branch built an unbounded number of independent copies — and that is
//! exactly what this catches.
