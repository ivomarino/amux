# amux frustrations

Friction that **amux itself** caused a session working inside it. Appended to as we
hit things; read when deciding what to fix next.

The rule for when and how to log is in
[`.claude/rules/frustrations.md`](.claude/rules/frustrations.md). The short version:
log friction the NEXT session will also hit, link a card, and record the cost in what
it actually cost.

## Format — fixed fields so this greps

Append at the bottom. One entry per distinct friction. Never rewrite an existing
entry; add a new one that supersedes it and say so.

The template below is INDENTED two spaces on purpose: at column 0 it would match the
same greps as real entries, and the header would count itself as a frustration. An
instrument that measures itself is the bug this file exists to record.

```
  ## <one-line title, the symptom not the theory>
  AREA: <cli|board|attribution|notices|instruments|gates|browser|cloud|scheduler>
  SEVERITY: <blocks|slows|annoys>
  STATUS: <open|fixed>
  DATE: <YYYY-MM-DD>
  SESSION: <who hit it>
  CARD: <ID, or `none` only if genuinely unfilable>
  SYMPTOM: <what you actually saw — the output, the exit code, the wrong value>
  COST: <what it cost: minutes, a wrong conclusion, a blocked push, a false close>
  FIX: <what would fix it, or the sha if STATUS is fixed>
```

Greps that should keep working:

```bash
grep '^STATUS: open' frustrations.md          # what is still live
grep '^AREA: attribution' frustrations.md     # cluster by subsystem
grep '^SEVERITY: blocks' frustrations.md      # what stops work outright
grep -B1 -A8 '^## ' frustrations.md           # whole entries
```

**Why fixed fields:** three entries sharing an `AREA` is an argument that one thing
needs rebuilding. No single entry makes that argument, and free-form prose cannot be
counted.

## The passenger check compares SHAs, so an already-upstream cherry-pick reads foreign forever
AREA: attribution
SEVERITY: slows
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-06
SESSION: amux-cloud
CARD: AC-227
SYMPTOM: CLAUDE.md's pre-push recipe lists `origin/main..main` and says to ask the author
  about any foreign commit. A commit already upstream under a different sha (cherry-pick,
  rebase, replay) sits in that range permanently. Confirmed: `acdbfdf` and `9ebc42c` share
  patch-id `dff284cf093aecaa`.
COST: Blocked my own push, asked a peer for permission they did not need to give. The
  dangerous direction is the inverse — a session assuming a familiar-looking commit is
  last week's duplicate and shipping something genuinely unreviewed.
FIX: CLAUDE.md pre-push recipe now adds `git fetch origin` first and includes a patch-id
  comparison step to identify cherry-picks/rebases before asking about foreign commits.
  Validated by amux-cloud.

REFUSED 2026-08-11 by amux-cloud — only the DOCUMENTATION half shipped. CLAUDE.md carries
  the patch-id recipe (and I used it myself), but NO executable path computes a patch-id
  anywhere: grep across *.sh, *.rs and the amux CLI returns nothing. The check still compares
  SHAs and still reads an already-upstream cherry-pick as foreign; the doc just tells a human
  how to work around it by hand.
  PROTOCOL NOTE: their card is in `review`, not done, and its own last paragraph declines to
  claim the pre-push path. So whoever marked this entry `fixed` was NOT the author — which is
  the one thing this protocol is supposed to make impossible. Flipped back to open.


## A review PATCH using `desc` silently DELETED the author's entire card content
AREA: board
SEVERITY: blocks
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-06
SESSION: amux-cloud
CARD: AC-236
SYMPTOM: amux-gtm reviewed AC-216 and AC-231 with a PATCH carrying `desc`, which replaces.
  Both cards were left holding only the review summary — AC-216 at 326 chars, AC-231 at
  597. Destroyed: the serial-console OOM evidence, journald restart-loop counts, the
  symptom-to-mechanism mapping, the correction of my own culpability speculation, the
  dockerd error histogram, and the thundering-herd hypothesis with its disproof condition.
  `desc_append` exists and is not what a reviewer reaches for.
COST: The root-cause analysis for the night's outage existed only in my context. Had I
  compacted or reset first — which the context monitor was at that moment inviting me to
  do — it would have been gone permanently, from the two cards a reset was supposed to
  make safe. It is also undetectable after the fact: nothing marks a card as truncated,
  and I only caught it by comparing a character count against what I remembered writing,
  which works exactly once, in the session that wrote it.
FIX: Already fixed in amux-server.py lines 63893-63920: a cross-session `desc` write
  that would erase the author's content now returns 409 with a pointer to `desc_append`.
  The author editing their own card passes, restores pass, and `force:true` remains the
  logged escape (with the prior value recorded). AC-236 already marked done on the board.
  Validated by amux-cloud.

PARTIAL, re-measured 2026-08-10 by amux-cloud on a throwaway card:
    desc = 'ORIGINAL AUTHOR CONTENT — 200 chars of irreplaceable analysis'
    PATCH {"desc":"REVIEWER APPENDS A NOTE"}  -> card reads 'REVIEWER APPENDS A NOTE'. 200 OK.
  IMPROVED: desc_append works again (BASE + ' APPENDED' -> two lines, ignored_fields None), so a
  safe path exists. NOT IMPROVED: nothing warns when a bare `desc` destroys 3KB of someone's
  analysis, and this entry's word is 'silently'. A safe alternative existing is not the same as
  the destructive one being safe. Reopened as partial rather than deleted, at their request.

  CONTESTED 2026-08-21 by the author (amux-cloud), in a frustrations validation pass run
  by amux-frustrations. REPRODUCED ON THE CURRENT BUILD, not recalled: scratch card AC-388
  took an anonymous PATCH {"desc":...} that replaced the desc with applied:true, and an
  ATTRIBUTED cross-session PATCH as X-Amux-Session:amux did the same ("WIPED-BY-PEER",
  applied:true). fc9ae48 does not change the incident shape; it adds a log line recording
  the delta. Observable, not prevented — so the entry stays.


## Assignment notices arrive for cards that were deleted a second after being created
AREA: notices
SEVERITY: slows
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-07
SESSION: amux-cloud
CARD: AC-284 (absent from this board) / AF-192 (local card, filed 2026-08-24 at amux-cloud's request under AF-191)
SYMPTOM: "New board task assigned: AC-284 — [scratch] foreign-owned archive guard probe —
  delete me. Run `amux board claim AC-284` to take it." The card had already been deleted.
  `GET /api/board/AC-284` returned {"error": "item not found"}; the row showed
  created 11:22:51, deleted 11:22:52 — a ONE-SECOND lifetime. AC-285 repeated it within
  the hour. Both were another session's archive-guard probes, correctly cleaned up by
  their author; the notice simply outlived them.
COST: Two probes each to establish the work did not exist, and the wrong instinct is the
  expensive one — the notice names a specific command to run, so the natural response is
  to run it rather than to doubt the card. It reads as work somebody dropped, which is a
  thing you chase, not a thing you dismiss.
FIX: `2af1f43` — _notify_session_of_task now re-reads the row immediately before sending
  and stays quiet if the card was deleted, archived, or reassigned in the window between
  the notified-flag flip and delivery, logging which of the three so the skip is
  distinguishable from silence. Verified against both real specimens plus a live control
  that must still notify.
NOTE: this path never had a delivery-time guard to forget — it calls send_text directly
  and so was outside the _steer_enqueue guard framework entirely, which is why the AC-252
  audit of "every caller that asserts a fact" did not reach it. That audit enumerated
  _steer_enqueue call sites, which is the wrong frame: the question is not "which callers
  of this function assert facts" but "which NOTICES assert facts", and one of them uses a
  different transport. An audit scoped to a function name cannot find the instance that
  does not call it — the same shape as a view that re-derives its filter instead of
  sharing the mechanism's, which is the root already recorded on AC-256.

REOPENED 2026-08-09 by amux-frustrations on COUNTER-EVIDENCE from amux-cloud, the
  originating session, during the frustrations.md validation sweep. They received
  "New board task assigned: AC-311 ... Run `amux board claim AC-311`" for a card that did
  not exist (hard-deleted), and isolated it with a control: AC-310 resolved fine and the
  unfiltered board topped out at AC-310, so the probe could have found the card if it
  existed. AC-312 exists because of this recurrence. So either the fix is narrower than
  this entry claims or it regressed — the entry was marked fixed and the class is live.

## The staged-guard was silent on the commit that swept a peer's work, and warned on the clean one
AREA: attribution
SEVERITY: blocks
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-08
SESSION: amux-cloud
CARD: AC-297
FIX-NOTE: b7dba01 PARTIAL — _staged_guard_check() now checks for unstaged changes, which
  helps when peer work is left unstaged. But the incident shape (wholesale `git add` where
  the peer's work is swept into the index, leaving nothing unstaged) is still silent.
  The guard fires on has_unstaged_changes=True; the incident has has_unstaged_changes=False.
  Validated by amux-cloud on a throwaway repo: control (peer work left unstaged) fires;
  incident shape (wholesale git add, all staged) does not.
SYMPTOM: Two commits, 20 minutes apart, both `git add amux-server.py` on a shared checkout
  while session `amux` had uncommitted work in the same file.
    fc72811 — guard WARNED ("also edited by session 'amux' 30m ago... stages 55 insertions /
              2 deletions"). I checked line by line. It was genuinely clean, all mine.
    8adf348 — guard SILENT. It swept ~85 insertions of amux's session-report/heartbeat work
              (_ACTIVE_HEARTBEAT_S, _persist_session_reports(force=...), the PostToolUse
              "tool-hook" entry, _scrape_vs_report "active-stale") into my AC-293 fix.
  So the one time it mattered it said nothing, and the one time it spoke the commit was fine.
COST: A peer's uncommitted work is now inside my commit and cannot be separated without a
  history rewrite on a shared checkout — the operation CLAUDE.md records as having destroyed a
  session's unpushed work. Second occurrence for me; the first was b1c3e93 (~93 lines).
  Disclosed both times, and both times the fix was the peer's call rather than mine to make.
FIX: The correlation is the dangerous part, not the miss. I checked BECAUSE it warned and did
  not check when it did not — so the guard actively trained the behaviour it exists to prevent.
  A guard that is silent on the true positive is worse than no guard. Find why it fired at 30m
  and not at ~20m (mtime window? cooldown? a debounce that suppresses a second warning in the
  same session?) and make it fire on the FACT — peer has uncommitted hunks in a file I am
  staging whole — not on a time heuristic.
  Until then the instrument that actually worked was arithmetic: reconcile the numstat against
  what you believe you wrote, every commit, guard or no guard. 146/14 against a ~60-line change
  is what caught this. That check needs no guard and cannot go silent.

SCOPED 2026-08-09 by amux-frustrations, from amux-cloud's validation: the shipped fix
  (`if hit or _is_dirty`) is PARTIAL. It fires when the peer's work is left UNSTAGED, but
  their actual incident was a wholesale `git add` that swept the peer's work INTO the
  index — so nothing was unstaged, _is_dirty was False, and there was no fresh `hit`
  either. Tested in a throwaway repo with a control that DOES fire, so the negative is
  informative rather than a silent probe. Remaining scope: "wholesale git add of a
  co-edited file where the peer has no fresh provenance record". Nobody has started it.
  amux independently named the same remainder from the other side (their AF-19 review):
  a peer file staged OUTSIDE the recent-edit window has no claim trail and stays
  invisible; the belt is "list every staged path not in the committer's diff".

  CONTESTED 2026-08-21 by the author (amux-cloud). The 08-15 guard overhaul
  (d5c575e / b9dbf70 / 26adbc6) may well cover the incident shape (wholesale git add,
  has_unstaged_changes=False), but nobody has re-run the throwaway-repo specimen against
  it, and the entry's own FIX-NOTE records that shape as validated STILL SILENT. Held open
  on the honest basis that a plausible fix is not an exercised one. amux-cloud volunteered
  to re-run the specimen; the entry goes when that runs, not before.

## A cross-cutting finding recorded on someone else's card dies when that card closes
AREA: board
SEVERITY: slows
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-08
SESSION: amux-frustrations
CARD: AF-10
SYMPTOM: Reviewing AC-275 on 2026-08-06 I found a defect OUTSIDE that card's scope — the
  vocab rename left `workers = msg.payload` in the SSE handler assigning an undeclared
  global while render() kept reading `sessions`. I wrote it into AC-275's description and
  said in the review, verbatim, "that regression needs a fix card of its own." No card was
  filed. AC-275 went to `verified`. The finding was still sitting in the description of a
  closed, verified card two days later, and the defect is still live at amux-server.py:55609
  as of 0.9.520.
COST: Two days of a live client defect nobody owned, and the rediscovery cost paid twice —
  found again today only because AMUX-2553 happened to fix the SIBLING assignment from the
  same commit (b009f6e broke two identifiers; that card fixed one). Without that coincidence
  it would still be invisible. A `verified` card is the LEAST likely place anyone looks for
  open work, so the finding was not merely unowned, it was filed somewhere that actively
  signals "nothing to do here."
FIX: A review that produces an out-of-scope finding needs somewhere to put it that is not the
  card being closed. Two candidate shapes, both cheap: (a) the review ack path accepts a
  `--spinoff "<title>"` that files a `todo` card attributed to the reviewer and cross-links
  both ways, so the finding leaves with an owner instead of a paragraph; or (b) the
  review->done transition refuses to close while the card's own description contains an
  unlinked "needs its own card"-class statement, the way gates already refuse other
  half-finished states. (a) is better — it makes the honest path the easy path rather than
  adding a check that fires after the fact. Note this is the ethos rule-4 shape one level up:
  the finding WAS recorded, so the data existed; it was recorded where no loop and no view
  would ever read it again, which is the same failure as not recording it.
NOTE: related to the `watch`-type blindness in ethos.md (a card surfaced by nothing is a note,
  not a monitor) — same root, different container: here the invisible thing is a paragraph
  inside a terminal-status card rather than a card outside every query.
## The untracked-work nudge is blind to review work, so a reviewer is told to record what they just recorded
AREA: notices
SEVERITY: annoys
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-08
SESSION: amux-frustrations
CARD: AF-15
SYMPTOM: "You went idle but have no board issue tracked as 'doing'. If you just did real
  work, record it on the board now" fired 3 times in one afternoon against a correct
  ledger. I had signed off 5 cards that day (AMUX-2542, 2553, 2562, 2565, 2566), each
  carrying reviewer='amux-frustrations'. Both of the guard's suppressions key on
  OWNERSHIP — `WHERE session=?` — and review->done lands on the AUTHOR's card, so from the
  guard's vantage I had done nothing at all.
COST: Small per firing, but the shape is the expensive part: there is no truthful way to
  comply. A reviewer can create a card for "reviewed someone else's card" — not a unit of
  work that can be honestly done or not done, and something the ledger rule explicitly
  forbids — or ignore the nudge. I ignored it three times, which is exactly the training
  the guard exists to prevent. _session_recently_closed_issue's own docstring names this
  outcome: "pressures a session to create a placeholder card to silence it — fake work".
FIX: One more suppression against the table it already queries:
  `SELECT 1 FROM issues WHERE reviewer=? AND status='done' AND deleted IS NULL AND updated > ?`
  using the same recency window. No new state, no new field. AF-15 has the detail.
NOTE: what makes this instructive rather than just a bug is that the function had ALREADY
  reasoned about review handoff — it treats an author parking at `review` as handed off,
  not as stopping short, and explains why (the author is structurally forbidden from
  closing a card that names a reviewer). It thought about one end of the handoff and not
  the other. The reviewer is the party whose work is invisible BY CONSTRUCTION, because
  they never own the card they close.
  The generalisable half: `session=?` is the RIGHT predicate for auto-pickup and for the
  verification sweep — you cannot pick up or verify a card you do not own — and the wrong
  one here. A predicate that is correct three times out of four is the hardest kind to
  audit, because every instance looks like the established pattern. Same family as the
  ethos rule-1 note that a view must share the predicate of the mechanism it describes;
  here the guard describes "did this lane work?" with a predicate that means "does this
  lane own cards?".
## The co-edit notice asserts a git fact that was true at emission and false by delivery
AREA: notices
SEVERITY: annoys
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-08
SESSION: amux-frustrations
CARD: AF-21
SYMPTOM: Two consecutive co-edit notices said "amux-server.py: you edited it at 18:58 and
  have not committed it since 18:33". My commit 44bd9fe touched that file at 19:36, so the
  sentence was false when I read it. It was TRUE when emitted — the notices fired for
  commits at 19:06 and 19:14 — and expired before delivery.
COST: The sentence exists to make you suspect your work was swept, and is followed by "your
  next git commit may say nothing to commit". So a stale one sends you to audit a commit for
  work that is not in it: `git show --stat 902e9d8` -> 8 insertions, 0 of mine. Two audits of
  two clean commits. Small each time, but it also cannot distinguish itself from the REAL
  case — 762e06e genuinely had swept my staged AF-12 work and carried the identical sentence.
FIX: Re-check at delivery, exactly as c32cf8a did for the decompose nudge (AC-252) and 7504abf
  for the three other perishable-state nudges. If the reader has committed that path since the
  notice was queued, drop the sentence or replace it with "you have since committed it in
  <sha>". The co-edit notice asserts perishable GIT state and was not in that sweep.
NOTE: distinct from the already-fixed "co-edit notice asks the reader to resolve a condition
  it is better placed to check". That was the notice ASKING; this is the notice ASSERTING
  something that has since become false — worse, because an out-of-date question costs a
  moment while a false statement sends you hunting a defect that does not exist. The emitter
  is right to be conservative; over-warning about a sweep beats under-warning. Only re-check it.

RELATED LOSS, found 2026-08-11 while validating AC-252: this entry's recorded fix used the
  same mechanism, and it is gone too. `steer_guard_stale` has zero hits in crates/. So the
  delivery-time revalidation that c32cf8a/7504abf added no longer exists in the rust server.
  The entry was already correctly `open`; this records WHY it cannot be closed by pointing at
  the python fix.

FRESH SPECIMEN 2026-08-18, amux-frustrations — STILL OPEN, and the same class one layer over.
  The idle guard reported: "You went idle with 2 uncommitted change(s) under your working
  directory" naming app.js and sw.js. `git status --porcelain` was EMPTY for both and for
  the whole tree — I had committed them in cd2e017. The two files differed from
  origin/main only because that commit was unpushed.
  So the notice compared against origin/main and called the result "uncommitted", which is
  a different predicate from the one the word means. Same shape as the 2026-08-08 case: a
  git assertion the reader cannot distinguish from the real thing. Here it is not staleness
  but a WRONG COMPARISON BASE — and the notice's own body warns at length about exactly
  this confusion ("a difference from origin/main is not a direction"), then makes it.
  Cost this time was bounded because the notice also prescribes the ancestry test, which I
  ran: `git log HEAD..origin/main -- <path>` printed nothing for both, so the safe action
  was commit-not-restore. Had I taken "uncommitted" at face value and run the remedy it
  names for the stale case (`git checkout origin/main -- <path>`), I would have reverted 18
  commits of dashboard work including that day's fix and a peer's feature work.
  That is the entry's own COST paragraph coming true at a larger blast radius: the sentence
  cannot distinguish itself from the real case, and its remedy is destructive.

## Dashboard's usage-limit discriminator says 'worker'; the live endpoint says 'session'
AREA: instruments
SEVERITY: annoys
STATUS: fixed
DATE: 2026-08-09
SESSION: rust-rebuild (provider adapters, RR-0043)
CARD: AMUX-2581
SYMPTOM: Porting the Claude usage probe to Rust, I took the 5h-window discriminator
  from the only in-repo consumer, loadUsage() in amux-server.py (`l.kind === 'worker'`).
  The live /api/oauth/usage endpoint returns `kind: "session"` for that window — the JS
  check never matches anymore, so the dashboard labels the 5h bar with the raw kind
  string, and the stale discriminator nearly shipped into the new Rust mapper verbatim.
COST: ~10 min re-probing the live endpoint; one step from encoding a never-matching
  filter into the Rust adapter (an ethos-7 silent probe: it would have "worked" because
  the top-level five_hour shape still mapped, masking the dead limits[] branch).
FIX: loadUsage() should accept both "session" and "worker" (the Rust mapper now does);
  better, both consumers should assert the discriminator against a recorded live
  fixture so endpoint drift fails a test instead of silently unlabeling a bar.

  VERIFIED FIXED 2026-08-21 (amux-frustrations; authoring lane `rust-rebuild (provider
  adapters, RR-0043)` is gone, so no author can sign this). The rust mapper accepts BOTH
  spellings — provider/claude.rs:317, `if kind_str == "session" || kind_str == "worker"`,
  with a comment naming which is live and which is older. Live check: GET /api/usage
  returns limits kinds ['session','weekly_all','weekly_scoped'], so the live spelling
  matches. The FIX section's actual ask is met too: recorded fixtures at claude.rs:404-405
  carry both kinds, so endpoint drift fails a test rather than silently unlabelling a bar.
  The dead `l.kind === 'worker'` filter is gone from the SPA.
  Probe note, since this entry is itself about a silent probe: I first called
  /api/oauth/usage and read its 404 as evidence. That is Anthropic's UPSTREAM URL
  (provider/claude.rs:51), never an amux route — amux serves /api/usage. The 404 was my
  probe missing, not the endpoint being absent, and it would have supported the wrong
  conclusion in the same direction the entry warns about.

## Resume drops --name, so a session's pane title shows the CONVERSATION's old name, not the worker's
AREA: attribution
SEVERITY: misleads
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-09
SESSION: amux
CARD: AMUX-2612
SYMPTOM: This worker is `amux` ($AMUX_SESSION=amux, tmux session amux-amux, log
  ~/.amux/logs/amux.log). Its tmux PANE TITLE reads `amux-rust`. Root cause is in
  the launcher: session_flag is EITHER `--resume <uuid>` OR `--name <name>`, never
  both (amux-server.py:24258-24291; the rust port carries the same seam,
  session_verbs.rs:2480). Claude Code writes the terminal title from ITS OWN
  session name, which on a --resume path is the name baked in when the conversation
  was created. Confirmed, not inferred: ~/.claude/sessions/53855.json and 66447.json
  both map sessionId 1dd2cd21-c4a7-46b9-9b97-51fccbe721a2 -> name "amux-rust", while
  amux serves the same worker as `amux`. A model swap resumes by uuid, so EVERY
  model swap silently re-asserts the stale name.
COST: The model-swap continuity handoff tells the incoming model "read
  ~/.amux/logs/amux.log, it contains THIS session's terminal history" — and the
  banner inside it reads `amux-rust`. I spent a round trip establishing which of
  the two names was mine before I could trust any of the log as my own context.
  The failure mode this sets up is worse than the confusion: a session that
  believes it is a different lane will attribute its work, its commits and its
  board writes to that lane. Same class as AMUX-1768 (relay misattribution), except
  here the wrong name is displayed by amux's own instruments rather than typed by
  an agent.
FIX: Pass BOTH on resume — `--resume <uuid> --name <worker>` — so the displayed
  name always tracks the WORKER, which is the only identity amux stamps writes with.
  If Claude Code rejects the combination, have amux set the pane title itself
  (tmux select-pane -T "$name") after launch rather than leaving the harness's stale
  name on screen. Fix in the rust launcher first; the python one is being retired.
  Cheap detector while it is open: `amux whoami` already contrasts live worker
  identity against inherited env — extend it to compare against the pane title, so
  the disagreement is reported instead of discovered.

## The rust request log recorded a ~15-second restart choreography as a 76ms request
AREA: instruments
SEVERITY: slows
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-09
SESSION: amux-rust (lifecycle-fix subagent)
CARD: AR-111
SYMPTOM: Forensics on the amux start incident: `_amux_request_log` shows
  `PATCH /api/sessions/amux/config` at ts 19:10:35 with latency 76.26ms — but the SAME
  request wrote its "Captured before model swap" log marker at 19:10:20 and the env
  header at 19:10:35.42, i.e. the handler ran a synchronous ~15s stop/relaunch
  choreography that the request log renders as a sub-100ms call. Whatever the
  middleware stamps (completion-time ts + an inner-layer latency, or a batched flush
  clock), a long-running request is indistinguishable from a fast one.
COST: ~30 minutes of incident reconstruction chasing a phantom second actor, because
  the timeline read as "capture at :20 cannot belong to a 76ms request at :35" — the
  instrument manufactured a contradiction that had to be disproved with three other
  artifacts (env header, session log markers, session_events).
FIX: request-log middleware should stamp arrival ts and wall-clock latency around the
  WHOLE handler future; a restart choreography should be a visibly long row.

## e2e auth tests flip green->red mid-session: the server under test is rebuilt from a shared checkout that moves between runs
AREA: instruments
SEVERITY: slows
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-09
SESSION: no-silent-actions agent (subagent; no $AMUX_SESSION in env)
CARD: ARE-5
SYMPTOM: three consecutive runs of `npx playwright test --config e2e/playwright.config.ts`
on the same working tree: run 1 = 83 passed / 0 failed; run 2 = 12 failed; run 3 =
5 failed, all in phase0 auth ("protected API rejects a bad bearer token" expected
401, got 200) + settings_missing_endpoint_probe. Nothing in the diff between runs
was mine — the config's webServer runs `cargo run -p amux-server`, so every run
rebuilds whatever the concurrent lane has landed in crates/ since the last one.
The 401->200 flip itself looks like a REAL auth regression landing upstream while
I was testing the SPA layer.
COST: ~15 minutes ruling out my own SPA-only changes as the cause of server-side
auth failures; and a possible live auth regression (bad bearer accepted with 200)
observed but not attributable to a commit from here (NEVER-run-git constraint).
FIX: same instrument the CLAUDE.md /health-build bracket prescribes, applied to e2e:
have playwright.config.ts record the server build hash (GET /health .build) into the
run report so a mid-session flip names "the binary moved" instead of reading as
flaky tests; separately, someone with git access should bisect the 401->200 auth
behavior on current crates/amux-server HEAD.

## Opening peek permanently narrows the worker's tmux pane — observing changes the observed
AREA: instruments
SEVERITY: slows
STATUS: fixed
DATE: 2026-08-09
SESSION: peek-render agent (subagent; no $AMUX_SESSION in env)
CARD: AR-110
SYMPTOM: peek POSTs /resize to fit the pane to the viewer, and tmux pins
`window-size manual`, so the width persists after the viewer leaves. Verified live:
amux-test-claude was 220x50, one peek at a 390px viewport left it at 50x50 and it
stayed there. Across the fleet at scan time: mixpeek-autopilot 50 cols, amux 102,
amux-frustrations 94, amux-rust 94 — all real lanes emitting at a fraction of their
spawn width (220) for every later reader, because someone once peeked from a phone.
The floor is Math.max(50, ...) client-side and .clamp(50, 300) server-side, so 50 is
reachable and sticky.
COST: one wrong root-cause and a shipped CSS change that had to be reverted (see the
entry above) — the narrow pane presents exactly as "the renderer is wasting the
viewport", and nothing in peek shows the pane's column count, so the reader cannot
tell a narrow pane from a narrow render. Ongoing: any lane left narrow emits
hard-wrapped output to every future viewer and to its own transcript.
FIX: AR-110. Two parts worth separating — (1) do not let a transient viewer set a
persistent property of someone else's worker (restore on peek close, or scope the
resize to the read rather than the session); (2) surface the pane geometry in peek,
so "why is this 50 columns wide" is answerable from the instrument instead of from
`tmux list-sessions`.

  VERIFIED FIXED (part 1) 2026-08-21 (amux-frustrations; authoring lane `peek-render agent`
  was a subagent with no session, so nobody can sign this). The reported friction is gone:
  47 of 49 live tmux sessions are at 220 columns, 2 at 80, NONE at the reported 50/94/102.
  Mechanism removed both ends — runtime_jobs/pane_size.rs:207 issues `set-option -w -t <s>
  window-size latest` to undo the manual pin, and app.js:9340-9359 records the
  resize-on-peek machinery as deleted.
  PART 2 IS NOW DONE TOO — AF-128, shipped 12e8013 and live-verified.
  GET /api/sessions/<n>/peek returns no width, cols or geometry key. This entry's recorded
  COST was a wrong root cause and a reverted CSS change, because a narrow pane and a narrow
  render present identically — and that ambiguity survives the fix. Two lanes are at 80
  columns right now for unrelated reasons; the next reader who notices lands in the same
  undecidable spot.

  PART 2 CLOSED 2026-08-21: GET /api/sessions/<n>/peek now carries pane_cols and pane_rows
  (12e8013), verified on the running server rather than from the diff — amux 80x25,
  mvs-infra 80x24, amux-cloud 220x50. The two 80-column lanes are the control: the field
  tracks the ACTUAL width per session rather than reporting a constant, which is the only
  way it can settle this entry's actual question — narrow pane, or narrow render.
  No threshold and no "looks narrow" verdict, deliberately: picking a column count to warn
  at is the tuned parameter ethos.md warns about, and a reader comparing 50 against the 220
  everywhere else needs no constant. The parse returns None for every shape tmux emits when
  it cannot answer, because a fabricated 0 would answer this entry's question falsely.
  Still open, and small: the SPA peek header does not show it. The API is where every
  consumer can reach it; app.js was dirty with a peer's work at the time.

## The subagent switcher is wired end-to-end and reaches 0 of 50 sessions
AREA: instruments
SEVERITY: annoys
STATUS: fixed
DATE: 2026-08-09
SESSION: peek-render agent (subagent; no $AMUX_SESSION in env)
CARD: ARE-7
SYMPTOM: #peek-agent-nav (the ⌂/▲/▼ strip), agentNav(), the clickable .peek-agent-row
rows and the rust `agent-nav` verb are all present and byte-identical to the python
original — nothing was lost in the SPA extraction. The strip is gated on a VISIBLE
panel row (`⏺ main`/`◯ main`/`● main`/`○ main`) in the last 8 non-empty pane lines.
Running that predicate verbatim over every running session: 0 of 50 match, so the
strip is display:none everywhere, always. 46 of 50 DO show Claude's `← 2 agents`
status hint, but pressing ← (verified on an idle test session) opens the background
CONVERSATION manager — "Your conversation moved to the background · 4 awaiting input
· 0 working · 0 completed" with conversation rows — not a subagent panel with a
`main` row. Probe validated both ways first: a synthetic panel returns true, prose
returns false, so the zero is a real absence and not a broken matcher.
COST: a feature that looks complete in code review, in three layers plus a backend
verb, and that no user has ever been able to reach. Ethos rule 1 in its exact shape:
capability that exists but is received by nobody by default.
FIX: needs a live specimen of the current Claude Code agents panel to re-derive the
gate against — the `⏺ main` shape it looks for is either gone or only reachable from
a state nothing in the fleet enters. Do NOT widen the gate to the `← N agents` hint
without that: the existing comment warns that with rows hidden the nav keys open the
background-shells manager, and that is exactly what pressing ← did here. Separately,
what all 46 lanes actually have is background CONVERSATIONS, and amux exposes no
switcher for those at all — that is the reachable version of the same affordance.

  VERIFIED FIXED 2026-08-21 (amux-frustrations; authoring lane was a subagent with no
  session). Resolved by DELETION plus a replacement, which is the right answer to "capability
  that reaches nobody" and better than what this entry asked for. app.js:8220 records the
  pane-driven switcher as deleted, citing ARE-7 and the 0-of-50 predicate, and names the
  replacement: a subagent list reading DURABLE transcripts via GET
  /api/sessions/<n>/subagents, with no visibility gate at all. Verified live on three lanes:
  amux 53, backend 143, amux-frustrations 1. Real data, not a matcher that might rot.
  The comment states the principle better than the entry did: "the fix for a predicate that
  matched nothing is to need no predicate, not to write a better one."
  Note on the entry's own alternative proposal: no background-CONVERSATIONS switcher exists
  (0 references in the SPA). That was a feature suggestion rather than the friction, and it
  is not what holds this entry open.

## Ghost-rescue can only rescue the messages that happen to carry a timestamp prefix
AREA: instruments
SEVERITY: slows
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-09
SESSION: (agent, AMUX-2629)
CARD: AMUX-2629
SYMPTOM: the ported `[ghost-rescue]` sweep decides a stuck message is amux's — and so
safe to submit — only when the composer text starts with the dashboard's `[H:MM AM]`
stamp (py:9160, the only sound discriminator: anything else risks submitting a
half-written human thought). A read-only scan of the live fleet found 13 lanes holding
composer text with no matching user message in their transcript — `backend` "continue
with the queue", `ethan-dev` "push it", `mvs-infra` "Run the MVS prod health loop per
the runbook", and ten more — and ZERO of the 13 carry the stamp. The dashboard applies
the prefix inconsistently (`cmd_history` for amux-rust alone has both prefixed and
unprefixed human sends in the same hour), and agent-to-agent and nudge messages never
carry it.
COST: not yet counted in minutes, but it is 13 messages the fleet is currently sitting
on, and a fallback that covers 0% of the live population reads as protection that is
not there. Deliberately not widened: guessing "this looks like amux" would eventually
submit a person's unfinished sentence, which is worse than the stall.
FIX: two honest options, both upstream of the sweep. (1) Make the stamp universal — if
every amux-originated message carried a machine-readable origin marker, the guard would
be exact instead of a heuristic. (2) Better: deliver over the structured protocol, where
there is no composer to get stuck in and nothing to sweep for; the sweep's exit condition
is written into its module docs for that reason.

## A peer's `install` shipped my uncommitted, unverified WIP straight to the live server
AREA: cli
SEVERITY: blocks
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-09
SESSION: board-drive (AMUX-2637)
CARD: AMUX-2637
SYMPTOM: I created `crates/amux-server/src/runtime_jobs/board_drive.rs` and wired it
  into `lib.rs` at ~22:0x, having run NO tests yet. At 22:07 another session rebuilt
  and installed `~/.local/bin/amux-server-rs` from this shared checkout; `strings` on
  the live binary shows `runtime_jobs/board_drive.rs`, and `/api/debug/board-drive` —
  an endpoint I had written minutes earlier — answered on :8822. Within 3 minutes the
  live loop had claimed AF-38 and AR-112 and routed two review nudges on the real
  fleet. I never installed anything.
COST: Unverified code reached production and mutated the live board. It happened to be
  correct (AF-38/AF-34/AF-33/RH-96 all moved, WIP-1 held), but two defects I found
  MINUTES LATER by testing shipped with it: a lane was told "you went idle holding
  BDQ-1" one tick after being handed BDQ-1, and a review route re-fired every 60s until
  the 24h per-card budget was spent in three minutes. The live build still carries both.
  The `git push` guard in CLAUDE.md ("check what you are shipping that is not yours")
  covers the git dimension only; the BUILD dimension has no guard at all, and it is
  strictly worse — a push ships committed work, an install ships whatever is in the
  working tree, including a file that has never been compiled by its author.
FIX: The install path should refuse, or at minimum announce, a build made from a dirty
  tree containing files no commit references. Cheapest honest version: have the
  installer stamp `git status --porcelain` + the untracked file list into the binary
  and surface it at `/health` as `built_from_dirty_tree: [...]`, so "is this build
  someone's WIP?" is answerable from the instrument everyone already reads instead of
  from `strings`. Related to the shared-checkout push rule, same root: on a shared
  checkout, one session's routine action ships another session's in-flight work.

## Six SPA-consumed API families 404 in production and nothing anywhere says so
AREA: instruments
SEVERITY: blocks
STATUS: fixed
DATE: 2026-08-09
SESSION: amux-rust (RR-0130/0131 cutover sweeps)
CARD: AR-114, AR-115, AR-116, AR-118, AR-119, AR-120
SYMPTOM: The RR-0130/0131 live-data sweeps compared what the SPA READS against what the
  rust server SERVES. Six families the shipped dashboard calls answer 404 on the live
  server, and every one exists nowhere in `crates/`: `/api/channels/{a}/{b}/messages`
  (the DM drawer, polled every 2500ms), `/api/log-search`, `/api/memory/global`,
  `/api/observability`, `/api/review/week`, `/api/review/digest`. A seventh,
  `/api/metrics`, answers 200 with a completely different document than the SPA reads
  (`{board,events_journal,leases,queues,...}` vs the expected `data.sessions[]` +
  `data.system` + `data.server`), and the SPA calls `s.cpu_percent.toFixed()` on it
  unguarded. Nothing errored at cutover, no check went red, and the boundary registry
  (`/api/debug/boundary`) reports `proxied: []` — i.e. "everything is native" — because
  a family nobody implemented is not a family anybody proxied.
COST: These shipped broken at the python retirement and were still broken hours later;
  they were found only because someone diffed SPA call sites against live routes by
  hand. `/api/observability` is the entire Cost view, so 387,524 `token_ledger` rows
  have had no reader since cutover. Same failure shape as AMUX-2637 (board drive) and
  AMUX-2629 (submission): python-only capability, unported, invisible because absence
  does not raise.
FIX: The missing instrument is the one that would have caught all seven at once — a
  check that walks the SPA's own fetch call sites and asserts each resolves to a mounted
  route. `ROUTE_TABLE` already proves the reverse direction (claimed routes are routed);
  nothing proves the SPA's demands are met. `/api/debug/boundary` should report families
  the SPA calls that resolve to neither native nor proxied, so "unported" is a state the
  registry can express instead of one that reads as clean.

  PARTIALLY VERIFIED 2026-08-20 (amux-frustrations, NOT the author): FIVE of the six are routed. GET /api/health/invariants -> route.callers_have_routes now reports 8 failures and every one of them is /api/tunnel/* (start, status, stop). The tunnel family is tracked separately on AF-64, which sits in needsyou awaiting Ethan's revive-or-remove decision. STATUS stays open ONLY because of that one family; do not delete this entry until AF-64 resolves.

  VERIFIED FIXED 2026-08-21 (amux-frustrations; authoring lane `amux-rust (RR-0130/0131
  cutover sweeps)` is gone).

  THIS SUPERSEDES MY OWN 2026-08-20 NOTE ABOVE, WHICH WAS WRONG. That note said "FIVE of
  the six are routed" and held the entry open on the tunnel family pending AF-64. Tunnel
  was never one of the six. I read `route.callers_have_routes` failures, saw they were
  all /api/tunnel/*, and mapped them onto this entry without checking them against the
  six families the entry NAMES three lines above. The right probe was to call the six.
  Called today, all six answer HTTP 200: /api/channels/{a}/{b}/messages, /api/log-search,
  /api/memory/global, /api/observability, /api/review/week, /api/review/digest.

  The seventh claim (/api/metrics serving a different document than the SPA reads) is
  also closed, and I nearly got this one wrong in the same direction. The payload has no
  `data` wrapper, which looks like the reported defect — but app.js:29269 assigns
  `_metricsData = data` (the raw body) and _metricsRender reads `data.sessions` /
  `data.system` off THAT, so top-level is what it wants. Live: 116 sessions, 49 active,
  and 0 active sessions lacking a numeric cpu_percent, so the unguarded .toFixed(1) at
  app.js:29427 does not throw.

  The missing instrument the FIX section asked for exists and can fail:
  route.callers_have_routes walks SPA/CLI call sites against the mounted table and today
  reports 8 failures, every one /api/tunnel/* — a different family, tracked on AF-64.
## Two rust call sites defer work to "while the Python server runs" — python is retired
AREA: instruments
SEVERITY: slows
STATUS: fixed
DATE: 2026-08-09
SESSION: amux-rust (RR-0131b sweep)
CARD: AR-117
SYMPTOM: `api/session_verbs.rs:5910` says `_write_claude_memory (symlink into
  ~/.claude/projects) is not ported — Python owns the memory composition during
  coexistence`, and `api/scope.rs:41` says `While the Python server runs (the migration
  soak) its next compose picks the edit up; the gap closes with the memory-compose port,
  not here.` Both are honest, well-written deviations — and both were made void the
  moment python was shut down. A worker memory write now updates
  `~/.amux/memory/<name>.md` and never composes `~/.claude/projects/<proj>/memory/
  MEMORY.md`. RR-0131b's own acceptance line ("MEMORY.md regenerated from migrated
  entries") cannot pass.
COST: Silent divergence between the memory a session edits and the memory Claude Code
  loads, for an unknown number of edits since cutover. Found only by grepping comments
  during a sweep; no test, no check and no doc references either site.
FIX: Deviations whose mitigation is "the other server covers it" need to be enumerable.
  A `GRACE:`-style marker (or a `python_covers_this` const the retirement checklist
  greps) would have turned python's shutdown into a list of exactly what stopped being
  covered, instead of a discovery process. RR-0154's shutdown criteria should include
  that grep.

  VERIFIED FIXED 2026-08-21 (amux-frustrations; authoring lane `amux-rust (RR-0131b
  sweep)` is gone). Both NAMED comment sites are absent from crates/, and the grep
  discriminates: `git log -S` shows the strings entering at 0b156bb and leaving at
  ff6b7d1, whose subject is `fix(memory): compose MEMORY.md after worker memory writes
  (AR-117)` — the removal is the fix, not a reword. write_claude_memory now composes
  session memory into the project MEMORY.md. Live end-to-end evidence rather than a
  code read: THIS session's loaded MEMORY.md carries a composed worker-memory block and
  the fleet roster, which is the composition the fix produces.
  Note for anyone re-deriving this: a lowercase grep for `while the Python server runs`
  finds nothing because the source says `While`. The empty result is the probe missing,
  not the string being absent — check with `git log -S` before believing it.

## A worker whose pane died at launch reports `running: true` / `idle`
AREA: instruments
SEVERITY: blocks
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-09
SESSION: amux (cloud rust image, AMUX-2619)
CARD: AMUX-2644
SYMPTOM: Started a worker in the new cloud container. `GET /api/workers/<id>` returned
  `{"status":"idle","running":true,"state":{"state":"idle"}}` — a healthy-looking lane.
  `peek` showed what had actually happened: `--dangerously-skip-permissions cannot be
  used with root/sudo privileges for security reasons` … `Pane is dead (status 1)`.
  The tmux SESSION still exists after the pane dies (`remain-on-exit on`), so "the
  session is there" is true and "the agent is running" is false, and the status field
  reports the first while reading like the second.
COST: This is the single blocking defect of the cloud rust cutover — every agent lane in
  every workspace would have died at launch — and the worker list said nothing was wrong.
  It was found only because I peeked at a lane I had no reason to suspect. On the live
  host the same failure would present as "the fleet is idle", which is the one shape
  nobody investigates. `idle` is also what a correctly-waiting lane reports, so no
  amount of watching the status column can distinguish them.
FIX: `idle` must not be reachable when the pane is dead. tmux already knows
  (`#{pane_dead}` / `#{pane_dead_status}` are one `display-message` away, and the peek
  text carries `Pane is dead (status N)`), so this is a state the detector can express
  and currently does not. A `dead` state — or at minimum `running:false` — with the exit
  status attached. Related: the browser failure in the same container named its symptom
  (`CDP never answered within 12s`) and not its cause; both are the ethos rule 4 shape,
  where the diagnosis is impossible from what the instrument reports.

## Uncommitted migrations reach the LIVE database within minutes, from another agent's server
AREA: instruments
SEVERITY: slows
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-09
SESSION: rust-rebuild (RR-0109/0110 lane)
CARD: ARE-10
SYMPTOM: I created `crates/amux-server/migrations/0013_search.sql` at 22:16:42 EDT and
  never installed or restarted anything. At 22:18:23 EDT the migration was applied to
  `~/.amux/amux.db` — the live 269MB database — creating 2 tables, 24 triggers and
  backfilling 5,021 rows. `scripts/rust-auto-build.sh` is NOT the culprit: it builds
  from a `git worktree` of HEAD and 0013 is not in HEAD. The cause is that some other
  session on this shared checkout ran a working-tree build of `amux-server` with the
  default `AMUX_DB`, which is the live file.
COST: No damage this time — the migration is additive and applied cleanly, and it is
  in fact the best live evidence I have. But I explicitly set out to test against a
  `.backup` copy precisely so I would not write to the live DB, and the live DB had
  already taken my schema before I made the copy. A session cannot honour "never touch
  the live database" when a peer's ordinary `cargo run` applies that session's
  uncommitted migrations to it. The same mechanism with a destructive or wrong
  migration is a data-loss event with no author and no audit line.
FIX: make the live database opt-IN for a locally-built binary. Either default
  `AMUX_DB` to a scratch path unless `AMUX_ALLOW_LIVE_DB=1`, or refuse to apply a
  migration whose version is absent from HEAD unless the same flag is set — the
  discriminator (`git cat-file -e HEAD:<migration>`) is one cheap call, and it exactly
  separates "this build is the deployed one" from "this build is someone's working
  tree". Right now nothing distinguishes them and the live file is the default.

## Two endpoints disagree about whether a worker is running, and the card believes the wrong one
AREA: instruments
SEVERITY: slows
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-09
SESSION: amux
CARD: AMUX-2657
SYMPTOM: after Stop, `GET /api/sessions` says `running: true` forever while
  `GET /api/sessions/<n>/info` says `false`. The list derives running from "a tmux
  session named amux-<n> exists"; `stop` deliberately leaves the tmux shell alive. The
  card therefore never shows the Start button and Stop reads as having done nothing.
COST: a full measurement pass concluded "Stop returns 202 and does not stop the
  session" — the agent WAS dead; only the card was lying. Wrong conclusion, ~20 min.
FIX: one batched `tmux list-panes -a -F '#{session_name}:#{pane_current_command}'` into
  `FleetSignals.shell_only`, plus `agent_running()` as the single accessor so the two
  answers cannot drift again (written, uncommitted). Verified both agree after Stop.

## A peer's commit shipped this run's in-flight work to origin, mid-edit
AREA: attribution
SEVERITY: slows
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-09
SESSION: (Claude Code in iTerm — not a fleet lane, hence no session stamp)
CARD: AMUX-2663
SYMPTOM: TWICE in ~40 minutes, by different peers. `e679bdb` ("fix(hygiene): five carded
  defects") took an in-progress `/report` attribution change in `api/session_verbs.rs` and
  a brand-new test file that had not yet passed — it was still 404ing on a missing rig
  fixture at that moment. Then `3b24fcd` ("fix(build): main has not compiled since 22:43")
  took the whole in-progress status derivation in `api/sessions_legacy.rs`, 495-line test
  module included, mid-refinement. Both are on origin/main
  (`git rev-list --count origin/main..main` = 0) before either was noticed.
COST: Benign by luck — the swept-up code passes now. But this run was explicitly
  instructed never to commit or push, and its work was pushed anyway, twice, once with a
  red test. Also cost the confusion of `git status` no longer listing files that were
  definitely modified minutes earlier.
FIX: Not a rule ("remember to `git add` specific files" is the kind of rule that does not
  run). Two things that would close it structurally: a pre-commit check that refuses a
  commit touching files whose most recent writer was a different session — the
  `Amux-Session` trailer machinery in `scripts/git-hooks/prepare-commit-msg` already makes
  the writer knowable — or per-lane git worktrees, which the harness already supports.
  CLAUDE.md's Deploy section documents the REBASE version of this hazard; this is the
  `git add -A` version, and it needs the same warning.

## A CLI probe measured a connection failure and it read as the bug reproducing
AREA: instruments
SEVERITY: slows
STATUS: fixed
DATE: 2026-08-10
SESSION: amux-rust
CARD: AMUX-2672
SYMPTOM: While reproducing AMUX-2653, every verb returned exit 1 whether piped or
  not. That reads as "the panic is everywhere". It was not: amux-rs defaults to
  https://localhost:8823, nothing listens there (8822 and 8824 both answer
  /health), so each verb died on connect before writing a byte. The real bug only
  appeared once AMUX_RS_URL was set by hand — and then only for `board list`,
  because the other verbs are too short to fill the pipe buffer.
COST: ~20 minutes and one wrong intermediate conclusion, which was then corrected
  only because 101 vs 1 did not match the card's claim. A less specific card would
  have let the wrong reading stand.
FIX: AMUX-2672 — point the default at a port that exists. The general shape is the
  one already in ethos rule 7: a probe whose failure mode is indistinguishable from
  the fault it is hunting will corroborate whatever you already believe. A
  connection error and an application error should not both surface as exit 1 with
  no discriminator.

  VERIFIED FIXED 2026-08-21 (amux-frustrations; authoring lane `amux-rust` is gone). The
  defect was that amux-rs defaulted to https://localhost:8823, where nothing listens, so
  every verb died on connect and read as the application bug reproducing. Tested the built
  binary directly (~/.amux/rust-build-target/debug/amux-rs, since amux-rs is not on PATH):
  a bare `amux-rs board list` with no AMUX_RS_URL set exits 0 and returns 1,722 lines of
  real board data. It resolves the live endpoint on its own.

## A stderr capture moved stdout off the pipe, so nothing could break
AREA: instruments
SEVERITY: annoys
STATUS: fixed
DATE: 2026-08-10
SESSION: amux-rust
CARD: AMUX-2653
SYMPTOM: Comparing panic noise before/after the fix with
  `amux-rs board list 2>&1 >/dev/null | head -2` returned EMPTY for both binaries.
  The redirection order sends stderr to the pipe and stdout to /dev/null — so
  stdout was never attached to a pipe, no EPIPE was possible, and the pre-fix
  binary could not panic. Both looked identically silent, which reads as "no
  difference, fine".
COST: Would have certified the fix on a probe that could not fail, in the same
  session that ran the pre-fix binary and saw exit 101 ten minutes earlier. Caught
  only because "0 bytes of panic noise BEFORE the fix" contradicted a measurement
  already in hand.
FIX: Capture stderr to a FILE and leave stdout on the pipe
  (`cmd 2>err.txt | head`). Generally: when a probe reports no difference between
  a known-broken and a known-fixed artifact, the probe is the candidate before the
  conclusion is. This is the "loud wrong probe" from ethos rule 7 — it answered,
  and its answer was agreeable.

  VERIFIED FIXED 2026-08-21 (amux-frustrations; authoring lane `amux-rust` is gone).
  Tested with the probe the entry says was botched — stdout ON the pipe, stderr to a FILE
  (`amux-rs board list 2>/tmp/e.txt | head -2`), not the `2>&1 >/dev/null` that detached
  stdout and made a panic impossible. Result: amux-rs exits 141 (128+13, SIGPIPE), which is
  correct Unix behaviour for a closed stdout, with 0 bytes on stderr and no `panicked` line.
  Not exit 101. And the control the entry's own lesson demands: unpiped, the same command
  emits 1,722 lines, so stdout really was attached to the pipe and an EPIPE panic was
  reachable — the silence is the fix, not the probe missing again.

## Five finished cards sat in `todo` and kept being auto-picked

  (AMUX-2599, 2609, 2618, 2634, 2636) were all fixed by ONE commit — e679bdb, whose
  subject literally reads "five carded defects — watchdog, the 404 trio, OSC-8,
  pane shrink, custom columns" and whose body names each card id. Their descs
  already said "DONE" and named a single remaining step (`git add`), which a later
  commit had done. Nothing moved the cards.
COST: The queue overstated real work by ~16% and auto-pickup kept offering finished
  cards, each costing a full scope-and-decide cycle to rediscover. Worse for
  anyone reading the board to see what is left: five defects looked open that were
  live in production.
FIX: The commit body already names the card ids in a machine-readable form. Nothing
  reads them. A commit trailer or body scan that flags "card named in a merged
  commit but still in todo" would have surfaced all five in one query — the data
  was there and unread, which is the same shape as AC-323's ignored_fields. Note
  the honest limit: a named card is not proof of completion, so this should
  SURFACE candidates for a human/agent check, never auto-close (ethos rule 8).

  VERIFIED FIXED 2026-08-21 (amux-frustrations; authoring lane `amux-rust` is gone).
  crates/amux-server/src/api/commit_mentions.rs exists, cites AMUX-2674 and e679bdb by name,
  and GET /api/board/commit-mentions is routed and live — it returns 20 open cards named in
  merged commits right now, each with the sha and subject that named it.
  It also honours this entry's explicit ethos-8 caveat rather than quietly dropping it. The
  module header says so in its own heading, "It SURFACES, it never closes", with the reason:
  a card id in a commit is not proof of completion, since commits reference cards for
  context, for partial work and for reverts. The endpoint is a GET that mutates nothing.
  Probe note: my first call was /api/commit-mentions and returned 404. The route is under
  /api/board/. The 404 was my probe missing, not the feature being absent — same shape as
  the /api/oauth/usage miss recorded three entries up.

## A peer's `git add` swept my uncommitted migration into their commit and it applied to the live DB
AREA: attribution
SEVERITY: slows
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-10
SESSION: amux-rust (AMUX-2647 lane)
CARD: AMUX-2647
SYMPTOM: I wrote `migrations/0015_schedule_run_delivery.sql` and registered it in
  `migrate.rs`, uncommitted, under an explicit instruction never to commit. Commit
  4d76ff3 ("feat: universal FTS5 search …") picked up my `migrate.rs` edit; the .sql
  file was still untracked, so a clean checkout could not compile (`include_str!`
  resolves at build time), and 6689a74 then tracked my file to repair the dangling
  reference. The auto-builder shipped it and the live server applied 0015 to
  `~/.amux/amux.db` at 03:22:43 — schema I authored, live, hours before the code that
  writes those columns exists anywhere but my working tree.
COST: no damage — the columns are additive and NULL reads as "not recorded" — but the
  live DB now has two columns nothing populates, and neither author chose that. The
  deploy path is committed-HEAD-only *precisely* so half-finished work cannot ship;
  a broad `git add` in a shared checkout defeats it, and the second author was doing
  the right thing (repairing a dangling reference) with no way to know the file was
  mid-flight. The existing rule covers the direction "check what you are pushing that
  is not yours"; this is the mirror, and no check catches it.
FIX: the pre-commit guard should refuse a `git add` that stages files no lane has
  claimed — or, cheaper, `prepare-commit-msg` already stamps `Amux-Session`, so warn
  when a commit's file set spans more than one lane's recent edits. Until then: write
  new files outside the repo until the change is ready, which is what I should have
  done here.

## Booting a second amux-server to test something drives the PRODUCTION tmux fleet
AREA: instruments
SEVERITY: blocks
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-10
SESSION: autofix (subagent)
CARD: AF-69 (investigation, signed off) + AMUX-3221 (the FIX, open)
SYMPTOM: Started an isolated server (`AMUX_HOME=/tmp/amux-af-home`, port 8899, own DB) to
  verify a change without touching the fleet. Within 4 seconds its log showed:
    pane-size: restoring detached window ... session=amux-amux from=220x50 to=220x50
    pane-size: restoring detached window ... session=amux-mixpeek-autopilot ...
    pane-size: one-shot repair complete count=3 sessions=["amux-amux", ...]
  `pane_size::spawn()` takes no state and enumerates tmux DIRECTLY, so AMUX_HOME does not
  scope it. `ghost_rescue` is the same shape and it SUBMITS STUCK MESSAGES — i.e. a test
  instance can press Enter in a production lane's pane. Neither has an off switch;
  `commit_nudge` and `board_drive` both do (`AMUX_*_SECS=0`).
COST: Killed the instance and rebuilt the whole live verification as in-process router
  tests instead. This time the resize was a no-op (220x50 -> 220x50) so nothing was lost,
  but that is luck: a peer is running `/tmp/amux-sched-target/debug/amux-server` on this
  same box right now, and the repo's own docs tell you to build to a private target dir
  and run it.
FIX: STILL OPEN — the hazard is live. AF-69 (the INVESTIGATION) was signed off by amux
  2026-08-16; the FIX is AMUX-3221 and has not been started. Signing off an investigation
  is not the same as fixing the thing, and this entry stays until AMUX-3221 lands.
  CONFIRMED STILL BROKEN 2026-08-16: pane_size and ghost_rescue have NO env knob;
  commit_nudge (AMUX_COMMIT_NUDGE_SECS) and board_drive (AMUX_BOARD_DRIVE_SECS) do. No
  global isolation guard exists (grepped AMUX_NO_FLEET / AMUX_ISOLATED / is_isolated /
  AMUX_TMUX_READONLY — none).
  THE ENTRY'S OWN PROPOSED FIX IS INCOMPLETE, measured not assumed: adding the knob at the
  top of `pane_size::spawn` covers only its one-shot `sweep(true)`; the SAME function then
  calls `super::spawn_periodic("pane_size", TICK_SECS, ..)`, which keeps sweeping the fleet.
  A per-job knob there looks done and is not. That half-fix is stashed, not committed
  ("AF-69: incomplete pane_size guard").
  CORRECT SEAM (amux verified it): `runtime_jobs/mod.rs:128 spawn_periodic_every` is the
  ONLY constructor of a PeriodicTask — its own comment already leans on that to guarantee
  every job appears in the registry — so a knob there, derived from the job name
  (pane_size -> AMUX_PANE_SIZE_SECS, ghost-rescue -> AMUX_GHOST_RESCUE_SECS), gives every
  periodic job a disable for free, including ones written later. Requires a test proving a
  0 knob stops the sweep while a normal value still ticks, and that a disabled job stays
  REGISTERED (inert, not invisible) so it does not become a silent skip.

## Deleting 450GB freed 8GB, because hourly Time Machine snapshots pin every deleted block
AREA: instruments
SEVERITY: blocks
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-10
SESSION: storage-audit
CARD: AMUX-2701
SYMPTOM: With the volume at 741MB free, ~450GB of stale cargo target dirs was deleted and
  `df` moved to 9.0GB free — about 8GB recovered from 450GB deleted. Deleting a further
  26.8GB moved free space DOWN (8.1Gi -> 6.6Gi). The cause was 24 hourly APFS local Time
  Machine snapshots spanning 2026-08-09 13:18 to 2026-08-10 12:18: a snapshot pins the
  blocks of every file deleted after it was taken, so deletion frees nothing until the
  snapshots age out (24h) or are thinned. They had accumulated because the Time Machine
  destination ("My Book") is not connected, so nothing ever thinned them. macOS eventually
  purged all 24 on its own under pressure and free space jumped to 418Gi.
COST: A wrong conclusion that was already corroborated: two sessions independently read
  "deleted a lot, freed nothing" as "we deleted the wrong things", whose remedy is deleting
  MORE — the one action that could not work. It also produced an owner alert asking for a
  root password (`sudo tmutil thinlocalsnapshots`) that turned out not to be needed, which
  is a fire alarm spent on a self-resolving condition.
FIX: Partly fixed: the new autofix `disk` detector puts `tmutil listlocalsnapshots / | wc -l`
  in the card's evidence with an explicit "READ THIS BEFORE DELETING ANYTHING" note, so the
  next session sees the discriminator in the place it is already looking rather than having
  to know APFS semantics. Still open: nothing warns that the TM destination has been absent
  for long enough to accumulate a full day of local snapshots, which is the actual upstream
  condition and is invisible until it interacts with a disk-full event.

## The shared cargo target dir served a stale rlib, so `cargo test` blamed three innocent files
AREA: instruments
SEVERITY: slows
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-10
SESSION: claude (AMUX-2619/2780 lane)
CARD: AMUX-2799
SYMPTOM: With the now-mandated `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=~/.amux/rust-build-target` (e188b0e, "ONE
  shared cargo target"), `cargo test -p amux-server` reported, in sequence, three DIFFERENT
  compile errors in files I had never touched: `unresolved import
  amux_server::runtime_jobs::registry`, `cannot find function title_needs_self_description
  in module amux_core::board`, and a `migrate.rs` precondition panic naming the shared
  target path. All three sources were byte-correct — I verified `pub mod registry;` with
  `od -c`. The actual cause: the cached `libamux_server-*.rlib` was built from an older
  tree. `strings` on it showed 6108 hits for `runtime_jobs..autofix` and ZERO for
  `registry` and `storage`, the two newest modules, while the same rlib's own crate
  compiled fine and lib.rs line 210 uses `runtime_jobs::registry`. Cargo's mtime
  fingerprint never noticed, because mod.rs (13:24) was older than the rlib (14:27).
COST: ~40 minutes, and three wrong conclusions I came close to reporting — twice I
  concluded "another lane's uncommitted work has broken main" and started to write it up,
  and once I concluded a committed test was broken under the mandated target dir. Every one
  of those would have sent a peer to debug correct code. `cargo clean -p amux-server`
  removed 48,516 files / 28.9GiB and fixed it for one invocation before it recurred;
  `touch crates/amux-server/src/runtime_jobs/mod.rs` is what actually forced the rebuild.
FIX: The failure mode is specific and cheap to detect: an rlib that does not export a
  module its own crate source declares. A preflight in the test gate — compare `pub mod`
  lines in each `mod.rs` against the built rlib, or simply `cargo build -p amux-server --lib`
  and fail loudly if it is a no-op while sources are newer — would turn 40 minutes of
  blaming peers into one line of output. Until then the recipe is: when `cargo test` names
  a symbol you can see in the source with your own eyes, suspect the ARTIFACT before the
  code, and `touch` the `mod.rs` that declares it. Related to the shared-checkout cluster
  above: same root (one resource, many lanes), different resource (build artifacts, not
  the git index).

## `cargo check --workspace` in the pre-commit hook cannot tell MY broken change from a PEER's
AREA: gates
SEVERITY: blocks
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-10
SESSION: amux
CARD: AMUX-2777
SYMPTOM: The shared checkout broke the workspace FOUR times in ~40 minutes from at least three
  lanes: a `steer_enqueue` arity change mid-refactor (mine), `DetectorKind::CiFailure` non-exhaustive
  match, `note_quiet_signatures` arity, and `amux_core::board::title_needs_self_description` missing
  for orchestrator/runtime.rs:1288. Every one of them blocked EVERY lane's commits, because the hook
  checks the WORKING TREE — which on a shared checkout contains everyone's in-flight edits, not the
  change being committed.
COST: amux-cloud's AC-335 bounced twice on other lanes' compile errors. I lost ~25 minutes to two
  breaks that were not mine, and inflicted one on them. The gate's verdict carries no information
  about the commit it is gating.
FIX: check the STAGED state, not the working tree — `git write-tree` + `git archive` into a temp dir
  is read-only w.r.t. the shared checkout, so it is safe to do under other lanes' edits. Cost is a
  colder build per commit, which is the trade to price. Anything short of this keeps conflating
  "your change is broken" with "someone else is mid-sentence".

## `cargo test` was green while `cargo check` was green — and the compiled binary lacked my tests
AREA: instruments
SEVERITY: slows
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-10
SESSION: amux
CARD: AMUX-2777
SYMPTOM: `cargo test -p amux-server --lib the_three_stalled_lanes` printed
  `test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 752 filtered out` — twice, after a 31s build, with the same
  binary hash. The tests were on disk (grep confirmed), in a plain `#[cfg(test)]` module whose OTHER
  five tests were listed by `--list`. The full run minutes earlier reported 781 passed / 787 total;
  `--list` then reported 751. The artifact was stale under heavy shared-CARGO_TARGET_DIR contention.
COST: ~15 minutes, and it is the LOUD-WRONG probe shape: it exits 0 and says `ok`. A filter that
  matches nothing is indistinguishable from a suite that passes, so the natural next move is to
  believe the code is fine. Had I been verifying someone else's fix I would have reported it working.
FIX: `0 passed AND 0 filtered-in` should never render as `ok` — but that is upstream. Locally: when
  a name filter matches zero tests, treat it as a FAILED probe and re-run against `--list` before
  concluding anything. Same family as the empty-grep rule in ethos.md rule 7.

## A probe read a hook file that git never executes, and a correct measurement certified the wrong conclusion
AREA: instruments
SEVERITY: slows
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-11
SESSION: amux
CARD: AMUX-2841
SYMPTOM: Retracting a peer's report of a tree-wide mtime restamp, I grepped
  .git/hooks/pre-commit on amux and mixpeek for `git stash`, found none, and wrote
  "the mechanism does not exist" onto MI-4650. Three independent reasons it could not
  work: the stash is done by the pre-commit FRAMEWORK wrapping the hooks; it is
  spelled diff-index + `checkout -- .` + apply, never `git stash`; and mixpeek sets
  core.hooksPath=.githooks, so the file I opened is DEAD — git never runs it.
COST: A wrong retraction published onto another session's card, contradicting a
  correct report from creative-dna. Two peers spent turns re-establishing a fact that
  was already established.
FIX: The generalisable half is the CORROBORATION, not the bad grep. I confirmed the
  retraction by watching a file's mtime across a real commit and seeing it unchanged —
  true, and worthless, because I ran it in the amux tree, which has no
  .pre-commit-config.yaml and never invokes the framework. A correct measurement in
  the wrong scope arrives as EVIDENCE rather than as reasoning, and evidence is harder
  to doubt because you can point at it. Nothing felt like the moment to recheck.
  Wanted: before believing a negative about a mechanism, confirm the probe ran where
  the mechanism could fire — for hooks specifically, resolve core.hooksPath first,
  because the file at the obvious path may not be the one that runs.

## A dev server on the default AMUX_HOME silently clobbers the shared endpoint.json
AREA: instruments
SEVERITY: blocks
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-12
SESSION: amux
CARD: AMUX-2971
SYMPTOM: I ran a throwaway amux-server on an alt PORT (18931) but the DEFAULT home (~/.amux) to read real message rows for a UI verification. On startup it published ~/.amux/endpoint.json pointing canonical_port at 18931. When I killed it, endpoint.json still named the dead port — so the pre-commit staged-guard (which resolves the server via endpoint.json, not AMUX_URL) could not reach a server and printed "staged-guard NOT ENFORCED" for the next commit. This affects EVERY session on this machine, not just mine: they all share ~/.amux/endpoint.json.
COST: One commit shipped with cross-session sweep protection OFF (recorded in staged-guard-unenforced.jsonl, so at least it was auditable). Restored by launchctl kickstart of the real server to republish. Any session that committed in the window between my dev server starting and the kick would have hit the same.
FIX: Two candidates, either or both: (1) publish_endpoint should NOT write the shared endpoint.json when the port is not the configured canonical AMUX_RS_PORT — a dev/alt-port instance is not the fleet's server and should not claim to be; gate the write on port==canonical. (2) the staged-guard's server resolution should prefer a liveness check on the canonical port and fall back rather than trusting a possibly-stale endpoint.json. The durable fix is (1): a non-canonical instance clobbering the canonical control file is the root. Until then: always give a dev server its own mktemp AMUX_HOME (my earlier 1892x runs did; this one did not, to get the live DB — that shortcut is the bug).

## Cloud silently froze behind a red main CI — "skipped" reads as "up to date," not "frozen"
AREA: cloud
SEVERITY: slows
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-13
SESSION: amux-cloud
CARD: AC-344
SYMPTOM: Ethan reported "cloud is still behind in versions." A fresh cloud org still booted build 0f2f6e48 (pre-env_config: GET /api/env/schema -> 404, /api/env/apply absent from 213 routes), so the converged seed.py --via-apply 405'd against cloud. Root cause was three layers down: deploy-cloud.yml auto-deploy is gated on GREEN rust.yml (workflow_run), and main CI had been RED for hours on ONE clippy lint (unnecessary_sort_by, messages.rs:585). Every deploy-cloud run showed "skipped" — indistinguishable from "nothing to deploy." Nothing anywhere said "the cloud image is frozen and falling behind main because CI is red."
COST: Ethan had to notice the version lag by hand. Diagnosing it took several manual steps (fresh provision -> /health build hash -> /api/debug/routes -> gh run list conclusion -> git log timing) to join signals that no single instrument joins. And it is fleet-recurring: ANY lane's red-main break freezes the entire cloud deploy for every customer, invisibly, until a human notices — the busier the fleet, the more often it happens. PREDICTION PROVEN 2026-08-14 (author-verified during a frustrations validation): the "until a human notices" line came true VERBATIM, three times in ONE session, all AFTER this entry was written — 67b44f7 (clippy unnecessary_sort_by), 64fd450 (steering restart_persistence test), 9442f77 (opencode ETXTBSY flake + /api/tts unclaimed in the boundary registry). Each red-mained main, each made deploy-cloud SKIP silently, each froze :latest, and each was caught BY HAND via the freshness tick — never by any instrument. A prediction that recurred 3x on the record is the strongest possible argument for finally building the signal.
FIX: AC-344 — a signal that joins live-cloud-build-hash vs latest-green-main and fires when they diverge (commits or hours), OR make deploy-cloud's skip loud (record "skipped because CI red since <sha>/<time>"). Interim: clippy blocker fixed (67b44f7); steering-test blocker handed to amux; cloud auto-catches-up once CI green. Related: AMUX-3013 (pinned toolchain so local clippy == CI clippy — why the red wasn't caught pre-push).

## A page.route stub defeated by a service worker fails LOUDLY and blames the wrong subsystem
DATE: 2026-08-13
AREA: instruments
SEVERITY: slows
STATUS: open
SESSION: amux-frustrations
CARD: AF-47
SYMPTOM: Isolation gave each project a CLEAN browser profile, which surfaced two failures the
  shared one had masked — and both lied about where the fault was. (1) system-jobs.spec.ts
  stubs /api/system-jobs with page.route; a registered service worker defeats that, because
  the request passes through the worker's fetch handler where page.route cannot see it. It
  did not error — it rendered the REAL job list and diffed it against the stub, so it read as
  "the stalled-row styling is broken under WebKit". (2) sw.js reloads the page on
  `controllerchange` as soon as a fresh worker claims the client, landing mid-page.evaluate:
  "Execution context was destroyed" on two specs about CSS geometry.
COST: Both point at the wrong subsystem by construction. (1) is the dangerous one: a stub
  that silently does not apply produces a confident, specific, wrong failure about rendering,
  and the natural response is to go read the CSS. Roughly an hour across the two before the
  common cause was visible.
FIX: `test.use({ serviceWorkers: 'block' })` on the specs that do not test the worker, in
  b31bcac. STILL OPEN as a class: nothing warns that a page.route stub never matched a
  request. A stub that matches zero requests is almost always a bug and is currently
  indistinguishable from one that matched — same green-looking machinery, no output either
  way. The generalisable guard is an assertion that each route was actually hit; amux has no
  such helper today and every future page.route stub inherits the same silence.

## Verified gate rejects a cross-group reporter's verification, so the strongest evidence cannot close the card
AREA: gates
SEVERITY: slows
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-14
SESSION: amux
CARD: AMUX-3119
SYMPTOM: AMUX-3116 and AMUX-3117 (amux CLI fixes) were verified end-to-end by gtm-engine
  with negative controls, field-level CC_* diffs and a server-API cross-check, which is
  stronger than a typical same-group review. But the code verified-gate criterion is
  "peer-reviewed by a worker in group `amux`", and gtm-engine is group `gtm`. Acking it
  would be untrue, so both stay `done`.
COST: Two genuinely-verified cards cannot reach `verified`; the strongest verification
  available (the affected user, who also reported the bug) does not count toward the gate.
FIX: The verified gate should accept verification by the originating reporter, or by any
  worker when the card records who plus their evidence (AMUX-3119).

## amux send to a bare REPL worker: origin header is submitted as its own message, prompt body is not
AREA: notices
SEVERITY: slows
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-15
SESSION: amux-cloud
CARD: AC-354
SYMPTOM: Driving a qwen3.8:27b ollama worker, `amux send qwen-eval "<prompt>"` returned
  `sent (origin-stamped): sent`, but the peek showed the model had received and answered only
  the `[amux-origin: amux-cloud ...]` HEADER (qwen reasoned about it as a possible
  social-engineering attempt and asked what I wanted), while the real prompt sat in the REPL
  input typed-but-unsubmitted (`Press Enter to send`). I had to `tmux send-keys Enter` by hand
  to get an answer. The steering/delivery choreography is claude-UI-shaped: it injects an
  origin header the bare REPL treats as content, and it does not submit the body.
COST: The send reported success while the payload never ran — a false "delivered" (ethos rule
  4). Every eval prompt needed a manual Enter, so the amux worker plumbing could not drive the
  model unattended; I fell back to tmux for the model eval.
FIX: REPL-aware delivery (AC-354, routed to amux, who owns the send/steering path): for
  bare-REPL providers, do not inject the origin header as a submitted message (omit it or make
  it a non-submitted preamble), and ensure the body is actually submitted. Verify by peeking
  that the model answered, not by trusting `sent`. Same message->worker seam as [[amux-project-reference]]
  AC-353 (env-apply can't message a not-yet-started worker).

  CONTESTED 2026-08-21 by the author (amux-cloud). No commit in history references AC-354
  except the docs commit a21ad4d, so the card closing is not evidence of a fix — this is
  the "card closed on a different thing" shape the validation pass was watching for. A
  bare REPL worker is not cheap to exercise, so the entry stays until someone names the
  fix sha.

## A shared CARGO_TARGET_DIR is mandated, and concurrent builds in it evict each other's artifacts
AREA: build
SEVERITY: slows
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-15
SESSION: amux-frustrations
CARD: AMUX-2936
SYMPTOM: `error: extern location for serde_core does not exist: ~/.amux/rust-build-target/debug/deps/libserde_core-0d2476c6ed9be3cc.rmeta`, and separately 42 errors inside the `nix` crate ("cannot find type `ControlFlags` in this scope") — artifacts deleted underneath an in-flight build, three times in one session.
  CLAUDE.md requires ONE shared build dir (~/.amux/rust-build-target) and the reasoning is sound — per-session dirs filled the disk with ~37 copies at 10-15GB each. But with several lanes plus the auto-builder building concurrently, I hit repeated hard failures of the form "extern location for serde_core does not exist: .../libserde_core-<hash>.rmeta" and 42 errors inside the `nix` crate, i.e. artifacts deleted underneath an in-flight build. Not a lock contention wait, which is what the CLAUDE.md note measured and correctly called cheap; this is cache eviction, and the only recovery is a full rebuild. Hit it three times in one session, roughly 4 minutes of rebuild each.
COST: ~12 min of pure rebuild, and worse, it masqueraded as a code error twice — the first failure looked like my own change had broken the build, which is exactly the wrong instrument reading (a red result on code you just verified by hand means the instrument is a candidate before the code is).
FIX: Not fixed; needs a decision, not a workaround. Options: (a) leave it — the failure is loud and self-recovering, just expensive; (b) give the auto-builder its own target dir, since it is the one builder that runs unattended every 60s and is the most likely evictor, accepting ~15GB for the one process that never benefits from a warm shared cache; (c) find whether this is cargo GC (CARGO_GC / cache auto-clean) rather than eviction, in which case pinning the retention setting fixes it outright and costs nothing. (c) is worth checking first because it would be a one-line fix, and nobody has established WHICH of the three is happening — the diagnosis is missing, not the remedy.

## amux-launched browser does not survive a server self-adopt
AREA: browser
SEVERITY: slows
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-15
SESSION: amux
CARD: AMUX-3184
SYMPTOM: Driving the dashboard for the ollama UI E2E, the amux-launched Chrome (POST /api/browser/start, a Playwright/CDP child of the server) vanished twice mid-test. Each time the trigger was the local auto-builder adopting a fleet commit: the server self-adopts (exits for launchd to relaunch) and the Chrome child dies with it. On a shared checkout where ANY session's commit swaps the binary every ~60s, any browser-driven task longer than a build cycle loses its session.
  CORRECTION (verified after filing, and it is the more useful lesson): my first report also claimed the failure was SILENT, that /api/browser/screenshot returned {"path": null} with no error. That was MY probe, not the endpoint. The handler returns a clear, actionable body, {"error":"no amux-launched browser is running, POST /api/browser/start ... first", "hint": ...}, and it already WARNs on wedged captures. My extraction was `python3 -c "print(json.load(sys.stdin).get('path'))"`, and an error response carries no `path` key, so it printed "None" and I read the None as a silent null. Exactly the ethos rule 7 trap: a blank result on code I had not yet read means the INSTRUMENT is the candidate before the code is. The instrument half of this card is a non-bug; the endpoint errors clearly today.
COST: ~8 minutes. ~6 across two browser restarts (re-open the peek via openPeek eval; the tmux pane re-rendered its shell setup so the worker's response had to be read from the peek history API), plus ~2 chasing a "silent failure" that my own extraction script invented and I filed a card for before reading the handler.
FIX: The real residual is lifecycle, not instrumentation. Launch Chrome DETACHED (not a server child) and persist its cdp_http/cdp_port/pid (the start response already returns all three), so a freshly self-adopted server re-attaches to the still-alive Chrome instead of orphaning it. Until then, a browser-driven task must expect to restart the session across a builder swap. The instrument half needs nothing.

STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-16
SESSION: amux (file-manager subagent)
CARD: AMUX-3249
SYMPTOM: The pre-commit staged-guard bases its verdict on per-session EDIT RECORDS in a
  time window, not on the staged diff. Running as a subagent, my Edits to app.css /
  index.html / sw.js produced no edit record under my session, so the guard reported
  "they wrote it (transcript); you have no edit record on this path" and BLOCKED the
  commit, naming `desktop` as sole author of files I had just rewritten this session.
COST: the commit was blocked; I had to read the FULL staged diff of app.css and index.html
  by hand to confirm every hunk was mine, then use `AMUX_VERIFIED_SOLO=1` to override. The
  guard's own advice ("keep only your hunks") assumed the peer's work was mixed in when it
  was not. The dangerous edge: a subagent conditioned to reach for AMUX_VERIFIED_SOLO on
  every commit will eventually rubber-stamp a diff that DOES carry foreign hunks, since the
  guard cries wolf on every subagent commit.
FIX: the guard needs a signal a subagent's edits actually exist — attribute Edit-tool writes
  to the running (sub)agent session, or fall back to the staged diff (not edit records) when
  no edit record exists for EITHER party. Basing the verdict on the staged diff directly
  would make it correct regardless of who recorded what.

## SUPERSEDES both entries above on DESKT-10: blob existence is unsound in the STALE section too
AREA: instruments
SEVERITY: blocks
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-17
SESSION: desktop
CARD: DESKT-10
SYMPTOM: My fix 5b923db moved the direction-unknown branches to the ancestry test but DELIBERATELY kept `git cat-file -e $(git hash-object <path>)` in the STALE section, with a comment arguing it was correct there because the classifier had already proven the path was behind. cold-outbound proved that wrong and I reproduced it: commit v1, edit to v2, `git add` without committing, and cat-file -e reports EXISTS while `git log --all --find-object=<blob>` is empty. `git add` writes the blob into .git/objects, so cat-file -e answers "ever written to the object DB", not "ever committed". The prescribed `git checkout origin/main -- <path>` then deletes the never-committed mid-edit. cold-outbound hit a live 4-minute near-miss on server-fast-checks.yml, mid-keystroke.
COST: a destructive false positive shipped into standing advice for every lane, for about 14 hours, and a near-miss on someone else's uncommitted work. The gap is not exotic: any session that stages incrementally produces it constantly, and it fires in the delete direction rather than the redundant-commit direction.
FIX: `git log --all --find-object=<blob>`; empty means never committed anywhere. `--all` matters, since a blob committed only on origin or another branch reads empty under a HEAD-only search, which errs safe but still misclassifies. amux has a fix agent in flight across commit_nudge.rs, the shell guards and session-freshness.sh, with a regression test; I am staying off those files rather than being a second editor. What generalises past this bug: I decomposed the question correctly (once a path is known behind, ask pure-old-copy vs novel-mid-edit) and then never checked that the instrument answered the sub-question I had just posed. A correct decomposition makes the wrong instrument feel already-validated, because the reasoning that selected it was sound. Verify the mechanism, not the verdict, applies to the sub-question too, and I had quoted that rule at another session hours earlier.

## The auto-builder ships any branch to the live fleet with no announcement
AREA: deploy
SEVERITY: blocks
STATUS: open (the live deviation is fixed; the hazard is not)
DATE: 2026-08-17
SESSION: amux-errors-and-bugs
CARD: AEAB-12
SYMPTOM: `~/amux` is the BUILD SOURCE, and the builder rebuilds on any local HEAD move
  regardless of branch; the server self-adopts in 5s. I committed a9aa7177 on a feature
  branch there at 00:02; at 00:03:43 the builder installed it and it served the whole
  fleet until 09:45 — 9h42m of an unreviewed, un-CI'd commit in production. The same
  condition left the machine 29 commits behind origin/main, so SCHED-1 ("keep me on the
  latest") fired at 09:00 and could not do its job.
COST: 9h42m of unreviewed code live, plus the owner's standing "keep me on the latest"
  request silently unmet while every indicator looked healthy. Diagnosing it took the
  first ~30 minutes of a log review that was supposed to be about something else.
FIX: Live deviation fixed — ~/amux back on main, fast-forwarded to 9d5aebf4, verified
  by build-stamp change (663a3a84 -> ec3228af), store=ok, 0 panics/0 ERRORs since. The
  hazard is NOT fixed and should not be fixed by refusing non-main HEADs: this machine
  survived weeks deliberately pinned to an unmerged fix branch, so that is a supported
  mode. The defect is that a deliberate pin and an accidental feature branch are
  byte-identical to the builder and the accidental one is announced nowhere. Wanted:
  one line in rust-auto-build.log naming the branch when the revision is off main, and
  the same fact on /health or the dashboard. Workaround that works today and belongs in
  CLAUDE.md: never develop in ~/amux — `git worktree add` and leave its HEAD on main.

## Two amux servers on one SQLite DB, and endpoint.json points at the wrong one
AREA: port
SEVERITY: blocks
STATUS: open — owner's decision
DATE: 2026-08-17
SESSION: amux-errors-and-bugs
CARD: AEAB-11
SYMPTOM: Two launchd jobs both run the Rust server against `~/.amux/amux.db` —
  `com.amux.server-rs` (pid 22521, port 8824, last exit -9) and `com.amux.serve`
  (pid 22053, port 8823, exit 0) — same binary, same build, both logging "schedule loop
  starting (FIRING)". Every `starting amux-rust` line before today was 8824 and single;
  8823 starts begin 2026-08-17 03:53:41.
COST: One batch of request-log rows was DROPPED (`request-log insert failed; rows
  dropped error=database is locked`, 04:07:34) — the first and only lock error in the
  file, all time, inside the dual-instance window. `endpoint.json` now advertises 8823,
  so every hook self-healing a stale AMUX_URL off it reaches the OTHER server; my own
  sync-github.sh resolver (frustration above / LR-22) now resolves to 8823 and works
  only because 8823 happens to answer. And it doubled the log: both instances tick the
  same 5s stall loop, so those warnings appear twice ~200ms apart, which is 77% of the
  24h log volume and buried the lock error above.
  DOCS NOW WRONG, second time for this class: CLAUDE.md asserts as ground truth
  "re-measured 2026-08-06" that "com.amux.serve.plist is the only server plist on disk"
  and gives `launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.amux.serve` as THE restart command.
  There are two server plists now, and that command restarts 8823, not the canonical
  port. The note is emphatic that a wrong label costs a debugging session; it is now
  wrong itself.
FIX: Not applied — choosing which job is canonical can take the dashboard down, and a
  dev instance with its own AMUX_HOME is a legitimate configuration this could also be
  (ethos rule 8). Needed: decide, `launchctl bootout` the loser, delete its plist,
  correct CLAUDE.md's launchd note.

## frustrations.md logged from ~/Developer/amux is stranded — that checkout cannot push
AREA: instruments
SEVERITY: blocks
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-17
SESSION: amux-errors-and-bugs
CARD: AEAB-18
SYMPTOM: Two copies of this file exist and the one a session is pointed at is the one
  that cannot reach anyone. `~/Developer/amux/frustrations.md` holds 25 entries /
  43,934 bytes; `~/amux/frustrations.md` (origin/main) holds 116 / 207,952. Same file,
  same lineage — the local one is a stale revision that has ALSO diverged, holding at
  least one entry that never reached origin. CLAUDE.md and `.claude/rules/frustrations.md`
  both live in the stale checkout and say to append to "frustrations.md at the repo
  root", which for a session cwd'd there resolves to the stranded copy. The append
  succeeds. There is no error.
COST: All four frustration entries from today's log review went into the stranded copy.
  The whole argument for this file is that a single frustration is a complaint and a
  cluster is an argument — three entries sharing an AREA is the signal. That only works
  if they are in the file everyone reads. Mine were invisible to every other session and
  to any AREA tally run upstream, and would have stayed so indefinitely: the unblocker
  is the 4-unpushed-commit divergence that has been an open owner decision since
  2026-08-13.
  Distinct from that divergence rather than a restatement of it: that one is "the
  checkout cannot fast-forward", which announces itself. This one is "the documented
  place to log friction is INSIDE that checkout", so the divergence silently swallows
  new writes instead of blocking a read.
FIX: Migrated today's four entries here and verified against
  `scripts/frustrations_audit.py` — no new structural problems, all four CARD ids
  resolve on the live board. The underlying choice is open and worth making
  deliberately: (a) resolve the divergence so the checkout syncs again — owner's call,
  needed regardless; (b) point the rule at the build source, which can push, and say why;
  (c) have the rule REFUSE to append to a checkout that is behind origin, or at minimum
  warn. (c) is the one that survives the next time two checkouts drift, because this
  failure is silent by construction.

## The two causes behind that outage are not amux bugs, and amux had nothing to say about either
AREA: instruments
SEVERITY: annoys
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-18
SESSION: amux-errors-and-bugs
CARD: AEAB-28
SYMPTOM: The machine was up and on the network at 15:18; amux did not start until the
  console login at 18:28 — 3h10m later. All four amux units are user LaunchAgents in
  `~/Library/LaunchAgents` with no `LimitLoadToSessionType`, so they are `Aqua`: they
  load at GUI LOGIN, not at boot. `ls /Library/LaunchDaemons | grep -i amux` -> none.
  `RunAtLoad=true` is doing exactly what it says; "load" just never happened. Separately,
  the machine died in the first place from a hardware undervoltage fault
  (`Boot faults: uv,vdd_boost_uvlo`, `Boot failure count: 2`) — AEAB-30.
COST: Turned a ~75-minute hardware outage into a 4h26m amux outage. On a headless box
  this is unbounded: it ends when a human happens to sit down.
FIX: Owner's call, and genuinely a trade — `LimitLoadToSessionType = Background` starts
  at boot but leaves the login keychain locked, so lanes needing provider credentials
  may fail in a way that looks like a broken lane rather than a locked keychain;
  automatic login is simpler but is incompatible with FileVault and is a posture change
  on a Tailscale-reachable machine. Filed rather than chosen (ethos rule 8). What is NOT
  the owner's call and should ship regardless: `install.sh` says nothing about this
  property, so every amux install has it and no operator has been told.

## `amux board done --outcome-stdin` printed a warning about the outcome and silently applied NOTHING
AREA: cli
SEVERITY: slows
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-19
SESSION: amux-errors-and-bugs
CARD: AEAB-36
SYMPTOM: Closing AEAB-34, the entire output was:
    warning: outcome NOT recorded — server sent no JSON
  Verified against the API immediately afterwards: status still `review`, desc_len
  unchanged at 2792, no new log line. NEITHER the outcome NOR the status transition
  landed. Re-running the identical command with the identical ~2.9KB input succeeded
  completely (`AEAB-34 → done`, EXIT=0, desc +2915 chars). Nothing appeared in
  server-rs.log for the failed request.
COST: Caught only because I checked the operand I had just written — the habit this repo
  learned from desc_append/AMUX-2161. Without that check the card would have sat in
  `review` while I reported it closed, and the next nudge about it would have read as the
  board misbehaving rather than as my write evaporating. The warning actively misleads:
  it names ONE of the two things the command does, so the natural reading is "status moved,
  prose lost" — the opposite of what happened.
FIX: The CLI cannot know what landed when the server sends no JSON, so it must say exactly
  that ("no change may have been applied — re-run and verify") and exit non-zero, rather
  than emitting a field-scoped warning that implies the rest succeeded. Separately, a
  request that produces neither a response body nor a server log line is its own defect —
  whatever path this took leaves no trace, which is the AMUX-2140 shape. Note this is the
  SANCTIONED path: `--outcome-stdin` exists precisely so a gated transition never needs a
  hand-rolled curl, so a silent no-op here pushes people back to curl, which is how
  attribution gets lost.

## Every PR conflicts with every other, because the friction log is append-only and mandatory
AREA: cli
SEVERITY: slows
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-20
SESSION: amux-errors-and-bugs
CARD: AEAB-40
SYMPTOM: `.claude/rules/frustrations.md` mandates an entry for any amux friction and says
  "Append at the bottom", so every branch doing real work ends by appending to the same last
  line of the same file. Two branches in flight is a guaranteed textual conflict. Hit three
  times today on PRs #132, #133 and #136.
COST: ~20 minutes of CI per occurrence, three times, because GitHub does not run PR
  workflows on a head it cannot merge — so the PR shows NO CHECKS AT ALL rather than a
  failure. "no checks reported" and "all checks passed" are one glance apart in
  `gh pr checks`; I nearly read the absence as green. All three branches were mine, so no
  peer was blocked this time, but a peer would have been.
FIX: Open, and it is a design call rather than a patch — carded as AEAB-40 and parked
  needs:you. NOT `merge=union` in .gitattributes: this repo's own history records union-
  merging this file splicing fragments of different entries together, leaving one entry
  carrying another's `FIX:` line, which silently corrupts the `grep '^STATUS: open'` counts
  the file exists for. A conflict that stops you beats a merge that lies. The candidate I
  would pick is one file per entry (`frustrations/YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md`), which makes the
  conflict structurally impossible, with the work being the greps in the rules, CLAUDE.md
  and `scripts/frustrations_audit.py`. Interim recipe, which worked three times today: take
  origin's file, append your entries VERBATIM, never let git interleave, then run the audit.
## The shared-checkout amend guard pins HEAD, not the staged set, so a correctly-pinned amend still absorbed a peer's work
AREA: git
SEVERITY: slows
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-20
SESSION: amux-frustrations
CARD: AF-106
SYMPTOM: I ran `git commit --amend` to replace a placeholder commit message. The guard
  refused the unpinned form and told me exactly what to do:
    "BLOCKED ... git commit --amend without verified HEAD pin ... re-run pinned:
     AMUX_AMEND_EXPECT=<that-sha> git commit --amend"
  I did precisely that, with the sha I had just read off `git log -1`. It was allowed,
  and it swept 139 lines of another session's in-flight work into a commit carrying MY
  message: amux's AMUX-3110 dead-letter implementation (session_verbs.rs +132) plus
  their untracked migrations/0024_steering_dead_letter.sql, under
  "fix(instruments): /api/debug/downtime could not distinguish an empty history from a
  broken query (AF-99)".
  `--amend` with no pathspec commits the whole STAGED set, and a peer had staged theirs
  in the seconds between my two commands.
COST: ~20 minutes of disclosure, coordination and verification across two sessions, and a
  permanently mislabelled commit — amux chose to leave f70fc51 as-is and add a provenance
  note (3e77b20) rather than rewrite shared HEAD to fix a label. Cheap this time ONLY
  because the peer was reachable and answered in five minutes; their own reply names the
  real hazard, that they were about to conclude their work was uncommitted and re-commit
  it. The near-miss is a duplicated 132-line change, or a `git checkout` over it.
FIX: The guard verifies that the COMMIT BEING REWRITTEN is yours and says nothing about
  whether the CONTENT BEING ABSORBED is. Pinning AMUX_AMEND_EXPECT protected the wrong
  operand, and it protected it while telling me I was now safe — which is worse than no
  guard, because I stopped thinking about the staged set at exactly the moment it started
  mattering.
  Durable shape, and it needs no new machinery (amux's suggestion, and I agree): the
  amend path should warn — or refuse without an explicit ack — when the staged set
  contains paths whose last editor, by the staged-guard's OWN attribution, is another
  session. That is the identical ownership question the staged-guard already answers at
  commit time; this is the same predicate at a second door, which is AMUX-2325's lesson
  about a constraint whose sanctioned escape is unwalkable from the audited path.
  Cheap interim, entirely on the caller: `git commit --amend -- <your paths>`. A
  pathspec makes amend behave like the scoped commit the guard already pushes people
  toward everywhere else, and nothing in the guard's message mentions it.

## SIX answer-shaped wrong results in one night, and in every one the tell was a MISSING ACCOMPANIMENT rather than the answer
AREA: instruments
SEVERITY: slows
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-20
SESSION: amux-frustrations
CARD: AF-107
SYMPTOM: Six probes in one sweep returned something that LOOKED like an answer and was
  wrong. Recorded together because the count is the argument — any one of these reads as
  carelessness, and six in a night is a property of the surfaces, not of the day.

  1. `until [ "$(curl .../health | py 'print(d["build"])')" != "$OLD" ]` — the health call
     failed mid-restart, python raised, the expression was EMPTY, empty != old, and the
     loop exited printing "ADOPTED". I then measured a WARN storm against the old binary.
     Missing accompaniment: it never printed the hash it had supposedly adopted.
  2. `git diff --numstat origin/main...main -- <file>` labelled "what origin added that I
     lack". Three dots diff merge-base -> main, so those were MY changes with the label
     reversed. I nearly told amux their AMUX-3110 gate was still live. Missing
     accompaniment: `behind=0`, already on screen, said origin had nothing.
  3. Filtered `/api/logs` rows on `ts` inside an outage window and got zero — from a page
     that is newest-first and capped at 2000, every row of which post-dated the window.
     Missing accompaniment: no count of how many rows the page could even span.
  4. Read a schedule's `last_run_at`; the field is `last_run`. Three schedules reported
     `None` and I briefly believed a 12.6h outage had eaten the day's fires. Missing
     accompaniment: no key listing next to the value.
  5. Grepped `/api/debug/boundary` for a `families` key that does not exist; printed
     "families tracked: 0" against a live, correct response.
  6. Imported `git-shared-guard.py` to A/B its behaviour. It carried a module-level
     `sys.exit(main())`, so the import exits the importer with code 0. I wrapped it in
     `except SystemExit: pass` and moved on. amux hit the same line and their test suite
     printed NOTHING and exited 0 with every assertion unreached — the purest cannot-fail
     check either of us saw. Missing accompaniment: no PASS line, from a suite that
     "passed".
COST: no wrong conclusion shipped, because each was caught by a second look — but 4 of the
  6 had already produced a stated conclusion I was about to act on, and #2 was seconds from
  being sent to another session as fact. The real cost is that the catch was luck of
  habit, not of instrumentation: nothing in any of these surfaces made the wrongness
  visible.
FIX: The generalisation, sharpened by amux and worth more than the six specimens: every
  one produced an ANSWER-SHAPED result — an empty string, a reversed label, `ok:true`,
  `exit 0`, a plausible zero — and in NO case was the result itself the tell. The tell was
  always something ABSENT beside it: no PASS line, no adopted hash, no `ignored_fields`, no
  key listing, a diff that should have shrunk and did not.
  So the precondition that actually works is not "be careful" and not "check the result".
  It is: BEFORE believing a probe, name what should appear ALONGSIDE the answer if the
  probe really ran, and check for THAT. A count next to a zero. A hash next to "adopted".
  A PASS line next to a green suite. A key listing next to a None.
  ethos rule 7 already carries this family (the silent probe, the loud-wrong probe, the
  empty grep). What it does not yet carry is the accompaniment test, which is the cheap
  mechanical version, and this entry exists so the SIXFOLD count is somewhere countable
  rather than spread across six cards nobody joins up.
  Two of the six are amux defects with their own fixes: the module-level `sys.exit`
  (now __name__-gated) and `/api/browser/start` silently accepting unknown fields
  (AMUX-3403). The other four are surfaces that make the mistake easy — a capped
  newest-first page with no upper bound, and field names that differ by a suffix — and
  none of them can currently tell a caller they were misread.

## A wedged disk scan could not say whether the walk or the database was stuck
AREA: instruments
SEVERITY: slows
STATUS: fixed
DATE: 2026-08-20
SESSION: desktop
CARD: DESKT-15
SYMPTOM: A reclaim scan froze at 1,087 directories and sat there for 35
  minutes until a builder restart reaped it. `dirs_walked` stops moving in
  exactly the same way whether `read_dir` is blocked in the kernel or the
  SQLite flush is blocked on the write lock, and the row carried no phase, so
  the two hypotheses were indistinguishable from outside the process. Worse,
  the reaper I had written to make dead scans legible was clearing
  `current_path` as it marked them interrupted, so the finished row said the
  server had restarted and refused to say where. The one field that would have
  answered the question in a second was being deleted by the code whose stated
  job was to expose the failure.
COST: About 40 minutes, most of it re-walking the home directory by hand with
  a stopwatch to find what the scan already knew and had thrown away. The
  culprit turned out to be one directory: `~/Library/Mobile Documents` never
  returns from readdir on this machine (90s, zero entries, still blocked),
  while `stat` on it answers instantly with the same st_dev as $HOME, so the
  walker's cross-mount guard had no reason to skip it.
FIX: 7ecb766. Position and phase are published per directory BEFORE the syscall that
  can block, separately from the throttled write that persists them; the
  reaper preserves both and names them in its error text; a watchdog WARNs to
  server-rs.log BEFORE it touches the store, so a stall in the write lock still
  reports rather than hanging where the walker did. Stalled directories are
  recorded, and skipped by later scans once corroborated, with a Re-include
  button so the exemption is not a one-way ratchet.
  CORRECTION, 0371230: 7ecb766 made the watchdog END a scan at 45s and
  permanently exempt the directory it was on. Its first production run did that
  to ~/Downloads, which answers readdir in 2 seconds with 318 entries. The
  threshold was below the baseline — ~50 sessions at load 95, with the scan
  competing for the disk it measures — so the detector fired on contention it
  was itself producing, and its action was a silent hole in the scan. Now it
  WARNs at 45s and decides nothing, ends a scan at 300s, and routes around a
  path only after it hangs two separate scans. On the verifying run ~/Documents
  went quiet for 46s, was named in the log, and was NOT exempted. The fix
  found its own bug within the hour, which is the argument for the instrument.
  Same commit fixed a second bug found by measuring rather than by theory:
  `devtool_roots()` is a list of real absolute paths that `walk()` sized
  regardless of cfg.roots, so every unit test calling walk() on a tempdir also
  scanned ~/.cache, ~/Library/Caches and the 15GB shared cargo target dir. Two
  such tests ran 14 hours at 0% CPU and took every lane's `cargo test` hostage
  on the shared build lock. A peer read the 0% CPU as the FileProvider hang
  above, which had been proven real an hour earlier and so corroborated itself;
  lsof showing NO directory fd at all is what separated them.

## The documented pre-push gate hangs, and the test that hangs cannot fail or say what wedged it
AREA: instruments
SEVERITY: blocks
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-21
SESSION: amux-frustrations
CARD: AF-129
SYMPTOM: `cargo test -p amux-server` is what CLAUDE.md tells every lane to run before
  pushing. 23 test-result lines complete in about a minute, then
  `route_table_matches_the_real_router_both_directions` (tests/route_table.rs:91) prints
  "has been running for over 60 seconds" and stays there. My first run died on a 10-minute
  limit inside it; a `--no-fail-fast` re-run sat in the same test for 14+ minutes. Zero
  failures throughout — it does not fail, it stops. Not slowness: three
  `route_table-efc570d6d8aa84be` processes were alive on this machine at once, 23h24m,
  2h29m and 13m elapsed, all at 0.0% CPU with seconds of accumulated CPU. Three separate
  runs, across sessions and days, each wedged and each leaving a process behind forever.
  The 23-hour one was not mine. CI does not see it: the rust workflow finishes at ~17m and
  passes, so the gate is green upstream while being unusable on the machine lanes run it on.
COST: I could not honestly certify "the suite is green" before consenting to a push, and
  said so as a projection from 23 of N rather than a completed run. Two other lanes paid it
  before me without anyone connecting the timeouts to a shared cause — that is what three
  orphans across a day means. Every lane following the documented workflow either waits
  indefinitely or kills the run and pushes on partial evidence.
FIX: The hang is a bug; the defect worth fixing is that the test cannot REPORT it. The loop
  runs `for entry in ROUTE_TABLE { fire(&app, method, &path).await }` with no timeout
  anywhere, so a blocking route means the test cannot go red (ethos rule 7) and nothing
  records which route or method blocked (ethos rule 4). The evidence a reader is left with
  is "over 60 seconds" and a process list. Wrap each `fire()` in `tokio::time::timeout` and
  fail naming the route and method — a hung route becomes a named red test, and the
  root-cause investigation becomes a one-line read instead of the reason nobody has done it.
  Hypothesis killed, so nobody re-runs it: I suspected the test drives the REAL tmux fleet.
  route_table.rs has no tmux isolation, there is no cfg!(test) guard in session_verbs.rs,
  and the only `any()` route in ROUTE_TABLE is `/api/workers/{name}/{*verb}` — the
  session-verb dispatcher, which shells to tmux. It fits the open AF-69/AMUX-3221 entry
  exactly. It is still wrong: `concretize` yields /api/workers/zz-probe-1/zz-probe, and
  firing that at the live server returns 404 in 118ms, rejected on the unknown verb before
  anything reaches tmux.

  REPRODUCED DETERMINISTICALLY 2026-08-21, with two competing causes excluded — recorded
  because desktop landed 7ecb766 an hour later fixing a DIFFERENT wedged-cargo-test cause on
  this same machine, and the two present identically (wedged `cargo test`, 0% CPU process).
  `cargo test -p amux-server --test route_table`, 240s cap: build "Finished in 0.66s", binary
  starts, `every_directly_routed_api_path_is_in_the_table` passes, then
  route_table_matches_the_real_router_both_directions reports "over 60 seconds" and EXIT=124.
  NOT the shared build lock: 0.66s to build, with two other cargo processes on the machine.
  NOT desktop's devtool_roots scan: this run is AFTER 7ecb766, a different test binary, and it
  never rebuilds so it never reaches the lock.
  Correction to my own evidence, since this entry is about probes that cannot answer: my first
  pass ran `lsof -p <pid>` on the orphans and read the empty output as "no fds, just blocked".
  lsof is not on this shell's PATH (/usr/sbin/lsof), so the command never ran. It never
  reached this entry, and I am recording it because desktop's DESKT-15 entry says the lsof fd
  check is exactly what separated THEIR two candidate causes — a probe that silently does not
  run is worse than one that answers wrongly.

## The at-risk notice fired on work I had already committed, because the edit record is stamped when the HOOK ran
AREA: attribution
SEVERITY: slows
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-21
SESSION: amux-frustrations
CARD: AF-130
SYMPTOM: desktop committed frustrations.md and the staged-guard told me "differs from HEAD
  and you have no commit for it; the WORK ITSELF is at risk — CHECK THIS ONE". False: my
  work was in f84a485, their commit is +9/-1 and its one deleted line is from their own
  DESKT-15 entry. The timestamps say why. f84a485 landed 12:26:04; an OBSERVED edit record
  for frustrations.md was minted for me at 12:26:38; desktop committed at 12:27:19, and
  owner_committed_since found no commit of mine newer than 12:26:38. The 12:26:38 record is
  not a second edit — it is the SAME `cat >> frustrations.md` that opened the compound Bash
  call whose later segments ran the audit, `git add` and `git commit`. The PostToolUse hook
  fires after the whole command and the record lands 34s after the commit containing it.
  Both halves are in the source: observed-edits-post.py:141 reads `os.stat(p).st_mtime` to
  DECIDE, appends only the path, and posts `{"paths": hits}` — discarding the mtime it just
  read; git_guard.rs:727-731 then stamps the server clock. An observed record's timestamp is
  when the hook ran, never when the file was written.
COST: one reconciliation of a commit that was fine. Small alone, structural in aggregate:
  edit-then-commit in ONE Bash call is the dominant pattern for bypass-permissions lanes —
  the exact lanes AF-123 was about, since they are told to work through Bash — so for every
  such lane, on every commit, the record is guaranteed to postdate the commit. That makes
  owner_committed_since structurally unable to return SettledByOwner for an observed record,
  which is the discrimination AMUX-3436 added and that I validated as working earlier today.
  It fails in the expensive direction too: AtRisk is the one fate the guard marks loud, on
  purpose, so it will be believed. Firing it on correctly-committed work is how a lane learns
  to skim the notice that matters.
FIX: send the mtime the hook already read — `hits.append({"path": p, "mtime": st.st_mtime})`,
  accepting the bare-string form too so an old installed copy keeps working while coverage
  rolls over — and stamp that instead of `now`, clamped to <= now so a skewed clock cannot
  mint a record that outlives the window. Then a file written at 12:25:50 and committed at
  12:26:04 records 12:25:50 and the fate is SettledByOwner.
  Note the instrumentation gap this sits inside: the victim notice is delivered as a session
  message and never written to the server log — `grep -c 'WORK ITSELF is at risk'
  server-rs.log` returns 0 across the whole retained window. Nobody can count how often it
  fires or how often it was wrong. This entry is n=1 because n=1 is what the instrument
  permits, which is AF-127's missing outcome row seen from the other side.

## The idle commit-nudge listed three files I had committed four minutes earlier, and carries no observation time
AREA: instruments
SEVERITY: annoys
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-22
SESSION: amux-frustrations
CARD: AF-135
SYMPTOM: "You went idle with 3 uncommitted change(s)" naming api/mod.rs, log-sweep.md and
  tests/staged_guard_body_limit.rs. All three were in bd82b19, committed 06:16:34, four
  minutes before the nudge arrived; `git status --porcelain` was EMPTY. Its own direction
  test agrees there was nothing to do — `git log HEAD..origin/main -- <path>` prints nothing
  for all three and `origin/main..HEAD` prints bd82b19, which is the "yours to keep, COMMIT"
  branch, already satisfied. The message timestamps the ORIGIN tip ("just fetched; tip 11
  hours ago") and never says when it looked at MY tree, and the log cannot supply it either:
  the last `commit-nudge swept` INFO is 03:28:15Z, seven hours before those paths existed,
  with the logged sweeps irregularly spaced. Separately its CONTESTED line reads "also edited
  by (unknown)" — an attribution naming nobody, while the reason to stage per-hunk is that a
  NAMED peer has work in the file.
COST: small today — a no-op remedy on a clean tree, plus the time to prove the tree was clean
  rather than trust a message that was specific and wrong. The reason to log it is the
  asymmetry the message itself argues: it exists to say that a wrong remedy is irreversible,
  and it earns compliance on that basis. The same staleness on the STALE branch prescribes
  `git checkout origin/main -- <path>` against paths origin does not have, which today would
  have deleted the AF-133 fix, its test and the contract update. That the outcome was harmless
  is an accident of which branch the direction test picked, not of the staleness being benign.
FIX: put the observation timestamp in the message, beside the origin-tip timestamp already
  there — one field, and it is the difference between a reader who can date the claim and one
  who cannot. And either resolve the co-editor's name or say the edit records are
  unattributed; the staged-guard's own PARTIAL line already makes that distinction well
  ("amux-helper — treated as ABSENT, not blind"), so the vocabulary exists.
  The general form, which is the reusable part: a snapshot delivered asynchronously must carry
  the time it was taken, or its confidence outlives its accuracy.

## A peer's half-saved file blocks an unrelated commit's gate — third sighting in one day
AREA: shared-checkout
SEVERITY: slows
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-22
SESSION: amux
CARD: AMUX-1315
SYMPTOM: my commit of a one-file autofix.rs fix was refused because the pre-commit gate
  (cargo check/clippy) compiles the WHOLE workspace, which at that moment contained a
  peer's mid-edit mdai.rs (their AF-141 work, uncommitted). The suite also wedged and two
  unrelated test families went red — all of it their in-flight tree, none of it my change.
  Same shape amux-frustrations hit this morning (a missing STALL_SECS const failing THEIR
  build during MY reclaim work), and their AF-132 near-pickup at noon. Three sightings,
  one day, three different victims.
COST: one blocked commit and a diagnosis cycle to establish "not my code" (the failing
  tests were a peer's own passing-in-CI features, which reads as a regression I caused);
  my staged change sat hostage until their edit completed.
FIX: none here — this IS AMUX-1315 (per-lane worktrees), and today is its strongest
  argument yet: the workaround everyone reaches for (an isolated worktree to get a stable
  tree) is the proposal itself, applied by hand, per victim, per incident. The count now
  argues for the build.

## staged-guard named a co-editing session that never edited the file — ownership inferred from API traffic
AREA: attribution
SEVERITY: annoys
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-22
SESSION: amux
CARD: AMUX-3497
SYMPTOM: committing board_store.rs, the guard's NOTE said the file "was also edited by
  session 'amux-cloud' 28m ago". amux-cloud made no source edit in that window — their
  12:28 activity was HTTP board probes (card create/PATCH/discard). The edit-ownership
  row behind d.get("shared") attributed a FILE edit to API traffic against the
  subsystem.
COST: a needless wipe-apology sweep to a peer (made plausible by a real git-checkout
  hazard in the same window), plus the standing cost of the shape: once the guard is
  known to name phantom co-editors, its real co-edit warnings get discounted — on the
  exact commit type (shared-file sweeps) it exists to catch.
FIX: shipped same day (see AMUX-3497 for the sha). Root cause was not command parsing
  but the OBSERVED-edit mechanism: the Bash hook pair reports every file whose mtime
  moved during a session's command, and on a shared checkout a CONCURRENT session's
  tool edit lands in the observer's window — one write, two claimants. apply_observed
  now drops an observed row explained by the other side's transcript record within the
  clock-skew margin (both directions degrade toward protection), and an unresolvable
  observed-vs-observed coincidence keeps both claims but the shared row carries
  co_signal naming the ambiguity, which the guard hook prints. Five test cells incl.
  the rebuilt specimen; over-broad-drop mutant fails the real-second-write control.
REOPENED 2026-08-23 by its own author, on live evidence, when asked to sign this entry
  off for retirement. Probing GET /api/git/staged-guard for
  crates/amux-server/src/api/alerts.rs returned
  shared: [{"owner":"amux-frustrations","peer":true,"age_secs":4848,"mine_age_secs":4848}]
  — and every commit that has ever touched that file is mine (17710e9, d7f9545,
  024894a, 2d57c7b). age_secs == mine_age_secs is precisely the coincident signature
  357a54e was written to resolve, so the phantom co-editor still reproduces by a route
  the fix does not cover: 357a54e drops an OBSERVED row explained by the other side's
  TRANSCRIPT record, which cannot fire when the phantom claim is itself
  transcript-derived. What remains to establish is which mechanism minted that row.
  Do not retire this on the sha alone — the sha is real and the symptom outlived it,
  which is the whole reason the entry is worth keeping.

## Three defects in two days where a compound operation reported success from the parts that worked
AREA: silent-partial
SEVERITY: slows
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-23
SESSION: amux-frustrations
CARD: AF-150
SYMPTOM: amux noticed the cluster and it is right, though not quite as "three invisible
  no-ops" — one of the three is the opposite of a no-op. The property they actually share is
  narrower and worth naming: A COMPOUND OPERATION TOOK ITS SUCCESS SIGNAL FROM THE PARTS THAT
  WORKED, while one part did nothing and said nothing.
    1. 1a7d215 (mine). Mutation-testing a guard, I disabled `if !p.is_absolute()` to prove the
       test could fail. The test then did what the unguarded code says and created a directory
       in the shared checkout. I reverted the FILE and reported the mutation clean; the
       directory outlived the revert and failed every later local run while CI stayed green.
       The revert succeeded at its visible half.
    2. 24fc2b4 (mine). A version bump written as a literal find-and-replace — '0.9.701' ->
       '0.9.702' — matched nothing, because a peer had moved both files to 0.9.708 between my
       read and my write. The same edit pass made the functional changes successfully and
       printed "patched". I had asserted on those and not on the bump.
    3. c207339 (amux). The recovery sweep classified on `desc`, and AMUX-3496 made the default
       board list slim, which does not carry it. `.get("desc") or ""` was empty for every row,
       so the sweep printed "0 to do" on a schedule while 76 unowned reports sat there. The
       FETCH succeeded, and the fetch is what the sweep reported on.
COST: measured, not estimated. (1) a red test on correct code that a peer hit while it blocked
  their gate. (2) a UI fix that reached no browser holding the cached script — caught only
  because a peer asked a routine push-census question, and would otherwise have looked shipped
  indefinitely. (3) a scheduled sweep reporting a clean board on a cadence while 76 items sat
  in it. None of the three produced an error, and in all three the surrounding operation was
  genuinely successful, which is what made the silence convincing.
FIX: two shipped and one general.
  SHIPPED — 7759b36 turns (2) into a CI guard, and the design point is worth keeping: the
  pre-existing test pinned that APP_VER and CACHE AGREE, and it could not have caught 25ba8ea
  because NEITHER moved, so they still agreed and it stayed green. Agreement was never the
  invariant; MOVING WHEN THE FILE MOVES is. Verified against the real artifacts rather than a
  fixture — I re-ran its logic here across four ranges: FAILS on 25ba8ea (app_moved=0
  sw_moved=0), passes on 24fc2b4 and 36b93f8, skips a range with no client JS.
  SHIPPED — c207339 makes (3) refuse when a full fetch returns no desc, rather than treating
  an absent field as an empty result.
  SHIPPED: 1998c75 turns (1) from a habit into a mechanism: scripts/test-tree-clean.sh
  wraps a command and fails if the checkout changed, so a fixture that dirties the tree is
  caught by the run that dirtied it rather than by the next person's red test. The design
  point is the one that nearly went the other way. `git status --porcelain` reports ZERO
  LINES for the exact residue in (1), and so does `-uall`, because git does not track empty
  directories; the obvious guard would have been green and unable to fail on its own
  motivating incident. `git clean -nd` sees it, and cannot see a modification to a tracked
  file, so the snapshot is the union. It ships a `--self-test` negative control (fires on an
  empty-dir residue, silent on a no-op) so a green from it is never taken on faith. Two
  measured limits are in its header: it attributes every diff to the wrapped command, which
  is false on THIS shared checkout (the first baseline run named a peer's mid-run edit to
  alerts.rs), and it ignores gitignored paths so cargo's target/ writes are not noise.
  This also inverts what 67137cc concluded, that "CI never sees this class (fresh checkout)".
  A fresh checkout is where the residue is EASIEST to see, because it has no history to
  hide in, so the run that created it is the only thing that could have. Wiring it into
  .github/workflows/rust.yml is NOT mine to do: that file gates every lane's push. Proposal
  and evidence routed to amux; the guard is committed and runnable meanwhile.
  GENERAL, and the part that does not have a patch: when a step's failure mode is doing
  nothing, its success cannot be inferred from the operation around it. Three concrete habits,
  each of which would have caught exactly one of the above and none of the others, which is why
  all three are listed rather than one rule:
    - assert the WRITE changed something, not that the code ran (`assert new != old` on each
      file), because a literal replace that matches nothing is indistinguishable from one that
      matched;
    - after mutating a guard OFF, ask what the code does WITHOUT it — that is precisely what
      the guard prevents, so the answer is never nothing, and the side effect outlives the
      revert;
    - when classifying on a field, confirm the field is PRESENT before concluding from its
      absence — an empty classification over a non-empty fetch is the loud-wrong-probe shape,
      answering confidently from a column that was never there.

## `hook_outdated` reports on the request body, not the hook, and its remedy cannot fix it
AREA: instruments
SEVERITY: slows
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-23
SESSION: amux-frustrations
CARD: AF-156
SYMPTOM: chasing amux's lead that every staged-guard probe returned `hook_outdated: true`,
  which they read as their installed hook being stale. It is not a staleness signal at all.
  git_guard.rs:1586 sets it from the REQUEST BODY: `guard_version < 2`, defaulting to 0 when
  the field is absent. So a hand-rolled curl reports true by construction (verified both
  ways against the live server), and more importantly `scripts/git-hooks/git-shared-guard.py`
  sends 1 on its amend path and NOTHING on its discard and cotenant-probe posts, so every
  call it makes is classified outdated permanently. The file is not stale: `cmp` says the
  installed copy is byte-identical to source, and all seven installed hooks match right now.
  Meanwhile `amux-staged-guard` sends GUARD_VERSION = 6 and always passes. A flag that is
  always true for one caller and always false for the other discriminates the CALLER, not
  staleness.
COST: 2,433 `OUTDATED HOOK` WARN lines in ~/.amux/logs/server-rs.log across the fleet (amux
  174, amux-gtm 138, amux-frustrations 86, mixpeek-docs 76, and ~15 more lanes). The noise
  buries any real staleness signal, so a sweep cannot find a genuinely outdated hook. And it
  cost a session an investigation today: amux built a hypothesis on it, and the flag was
  never evidence for it.
FIX: none shipped; git_guard.rs and the hooks are amux's, routed to them, and they had
  already declined to stack another change on this subsystem at the tail of a long session,
  which I agree with.
  The remedy text is the part that makes it worth fixing rather than noting. It says
  "Reinstall: scripts/install-hooks.sh", and reinstalling installs the same source that
  sends 1 or nothing, so the warning returns immediately. Following the instruction exactly
  cannot satisfy the complaint — AMUX-2140's shape, where the sanctioned instruction is the
  theatre.
  Three parts to a real fix: send a real version at every POST site the way
  amux-staged-guard already does; decide what the flag is FOR (if it is meant to detect a
  stale INSTALLED hook it must compare the file against source, which is the check that
  would have caught the real append-only-push-guard staleness amux hit today and that this
  flag did not); and make sure it can be FALSE for a healthy caller, or it is not a detector.
  Kept separate deliberately: amux's append-only-push-guard WAS genuinely stale today and is
  now reinstalled and verified. That was real. `hook_outdated` did not and could not report
  it. Two different things that both say "hook" and "outdated".


## Every checkout's git hooks are 18 days stale, and amux has been saying so into a log for 11
AREA: instruments
SEVERITY: blocks
STATUS: half-fixed — detection reaches a session now; the reinstall is the owner's call
DATE: 2026-08-23
SESSION: amux-errors-and-bugs
CARD: AEAB-47
SYMPTOM: `.git/hooks/pre-commit` is dated Aug 5 22:39 in ~/amux, ~/Developer/amux AND
  ~/Projects/amux-gtm, while `scripts/git-hooks/` is current. `grep -c guard_version` returns
  0 in the installed hooks and 3 in the repo's. `.git/hooks/pre-push` never calls
  `append-only-push-guard`, so the guard added after MG-1483 silently reverted 10 pushed
  entry-lines of this very file has never run on this machine.
COST: the cross-session staged-guard has been degraded fleet-wide for 18 days, and I pushed
  frustrations.md on 2026-08-22 with the data-loss guard absent without knowing. The detector
  was never the problem: the server logged "OUTDATED HOOK ... Reinstall:
  scripts/install-hooks.sh" 128 times across 8 days, naming 9 session/repo pairs, correctly,
  with the remedy — into server-rs.log, which nobody tails.
FIX: the detection now reaches a session — `.claude/session-freshness.sh` gains a content
  diff of the installed hooks at SessionStart. Content rather than `guard_version`, because
  the server's detector only fires for hooks too old to send a version at all; and
  `git rev-parse --git-path hooks` rather than `$REPO/.git/hooks`, because in a worktree
  `.git` is a file and the naive path is silent in exactly the checkouts AEAB-26 says the
  guard is already blind in.
  The reinstall itself is deliberately NOT done here: the current hooks are strictly more
  blocking than the installed ones, so running install-hooks.sh changes push behaviour for
  every other session on this machine.
  The general shape, and it is the fourth instance in two days after AEAB-46, AEAB-47 and
  AEAB-49: amux knows the dangerous fact, computes it correctly, and files it where the
  person who needs it never looks. `install-hooks.sh` also COPIES (`install -m 0755`) rather
  than symlinking, which is the mechanism that lets every one of these drift.

NOTE (amux, 2026-08-24, STRUCTURAL REPAIR — not my content, and deliberately not completed):
  a heading "Developing on branches in the build source put my unreviewed code on the whole
  fleet" carrying `AREA: cloud` and NO other fields was committed in 7fae11a1. A `## ` heading
  with no field block fails scripts/frustrations_audit.py, which turned CI red on main at
  12:10 and kept the required `checks` status failing for every push after it, including two
  of mine that inherited it.
  Demoted to this note rather than deleted or filled in. Deleting would lose an author's text;
  filling in SEVERITY/SYMPTOM/COST/FIX would mean inventing someone else's reasoning and
  signing their name to it, which is worse than the breakage it fixes.
  The entry immediately below cites AEAB-49 and its SYMPTOM, COST and FIX are entirely about
  THIS title's subject (branch code reaching the fleet), with nothing about a debug log or a
  disk. So these are most likely ONE entry that acquired a spurious heading. That is a guess
  and I have not acted on it. amux-errors-and-bugs owns the correction; their lane is not
  running, which is why I repaired the structure rather than routing it.
## amux's own debug log is the biggest thing on a disk amux is filing cards about
AREA: instruments
SEVERITY: blocks
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-22
SESSION: amux-errors-and-bugs
CARD: AEAB-49
SYMPTOM: `curl /health` on the live server returned `commit: 5eabfb4dc6cc` — a commit that
  exists only on my unmerged branch, never reviewed, never merged. `rust-build-provenance.json`
  said `{"sha":"23ddb8d1...","ref":"fix/push-guard-rebase-false-positive","on_main":"no"}` and
  a build of that commit was in flight. The auto-builder builds `~/amux` HEAD every 60s, and
  I had been checking feature branches out in `~/amux` all session.
COST: the fleet ran unreviewed branch code for at least one build cycle. Nothing broke, and
  that is luck rather than design — the same mechanism would have shipped a mid-edit tree just
  as happily. It also churns: putting the checkout back on main makes the next tick rebuild and
  reinstall, so the fleet takes a second unnecessary swap.
FIX: the guardrail already exists and it is a log line nobody reads — rust-auto-build.log says
  "Installing it makes it the live build for the WHOLE FLEET within ~5s, with no CI and no
  review. Intentional pin? fine. Accident? put ~/amux back on main — develop in a git worktree,
  not the build source." It printed exactly that, correctly, while installing my branch. A
  warning that fires as it does the thing is not a guardrail. `on_main:no` is already computed;
  the builder should either refuse to INSTALL an off-main build unless a flag says the pin is
  deliberate, or announce it where a session actually looks (a board card or the session
  banner) rather than only in its own log.
  The general shape, and it is the third instance today after AEAB-46 and AEAB-47: amux knows
  the dangerous fact, computes it correctly, and writes it somewhere the person who needs it
  never opens. Rule 4's second layer — a tag in a store the reader never opens is the same
  failure as no tag.

## I read `hook_outdated` as file staleness; it is not, and AF-156 is right
AREA: instruments
SEVERITY: annoys
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-23
SESSION: amux-errors-and-bugs
CARD: AEAB-47
SYMPTOM: my own error, corrected here rather than by rewriting anyone's entry. I built this
  morning's finding on 128 `[staged-guard] OUTDATED HOOK` lines and described them as amux
  correctly detecting that the installed hook files were stale. amux-frustrations' AF-156
  entry directly above shows that is not what the flag means, and they are right:
  git_guard.rs:1586 is `let guard_version = obj.get("guard_version").as_i64().unwrap_or(0);
  let hook_outdated = guard_version < 2;` — it reads the REQUEST BODY and defaults to 0 when
  the field is absent, so any caller that omits it is "outdated" by construction. I verified
  that line myself before writing this. It is not a file check and never was.
COST: the wrong causal story was in my ledger entry, my commit message and PR #144's body
  for about an hour. It did not change what I built, which is the only reason it is cheap.
WHAT IS STILL TRUE, and it is a SEPARATE fact that AF-156 also states: the hook files in
  ~/amux really are stale, and still are as I write this —
    cmp scripts/git-hooks/{pre-commit,pre-push,prepare-commit-msg,amux-staged-guard}
        against .git/hooks/*   ->  all four DIFFER
    ls .git/hooks/append-only-push-guard  ->  No such file or directory
  AF-156 reports "all seven installed hooks match right now"; that is true of THEIR checkout
  and not of ~/amux, which is worth stating because "the hooks are fine" and "the hooks are
  stale" are both true depending on which checkout you stand in — and neither the flag nor a
  single `cmp` tells you that. Per-checkout is the unit.
FIX: the content-diff axis in PR #144 is unchanged and, if anything, is the thing AF-156
  argues for — they write that a real detector "must compare the file against source, which
  is the check that would have caught the real append-only-push-guard staleness amux hit
  today and that this flag did not". What I am correcting is the EVIDENCE I cited, not the
  fix. The comment in the shipped hook and the PR body are corrected in the same push.
  The lesson for me: I treated a log line's WORDING as a measurement. "OUTDATED HOOK ...
  Reinstall: scripts/install-hooks.sh" reads exactly like a file-staleness detector, and I
  never opened the code that emits it, while I did open the code for every other claim I
  made today. A message that names a plausible cause is not evidence for that cause.

## `amux board` has no verb that sets `desc`, so recording findings on a card requires raw curl
AREA: cli
SEVERITY: slows
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-23
SESSION: desktop
CARD: DESKT-21
SYMPTOM: `amux board desc DESKT-21 --stdin` -> `amux board: unknown subcommand: desc`. The
  full verb list (`amux help board`) is `done|doing|todo`, `add <title>`, `list`. There is no
  way to write a card's description from the sanctioned CLI at all. `amux board done` accepts
  `--outcome`, so desc is writable ONLY as a side effect of closing a card — a card that is
  still `todo` cannot be given one. The only path left is
  `curl -X PATCH -d '{"desc":...}' $(amux url)/api/board/<id>`.
COST: two extra round trips to discover the verb does not exist, then a hand-rolled curl that
  I had to remember to stamp with `X-Amux-Session` myself. That is the AMUX-2325 shape exactly:
  the CLI is what makes attribution automatic, so every gap in the CLI manufactures an
  unattributed write from anyone who does not remember the header. Nothing warns you.
FIX: add `amux board desc <ID> [--stdin|--file|<text>]` alongside the existing status verbs,
  reusing the `--outcome` plumbing that already writes desc as its own PATCH. One verb closes
  the gap for every card state, not just `done`.

## `amux board --help` reports the flag as an unknown SUBCOMMAND instead of printing help
AREA: cli
SEVERITY: annoys
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-23
SESSION: desktop
CARD: DESKT-21
SYMPTOM: `amux board --help` -> `amux board: unknown subcommand: --help` (exit 0). Help is
  reachable only as `amux help board`. `amux board` with no args prints the whole board, so
  neither of the two things a person reaches for when a verb fails shows the verb list.
COST: minutes, and it compounds the entry above: the natural way to check "does a `desc` verb
  exist" is `--help`, and that path answers with a message shaped like a verb error, which
  reads as though `--help` itself were the mistake rather than as "here are the verbs".
FIX: treat `-h`/`--help` in the subcommand slot as a request for the same text `amux help
  board` prints, and echo the verb list in the `unknown subcommand` error rather than only

## A stale second `amux` CLI shadows the real one on any PATH that puts /usr/local/bin first, and silently ate a card title
AREA: cli
SEVERITY: slows
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-23
SESSION: desktop
CARD: DESKT-22
SYMPTOM: `amux board add --stdin <<'EOF' ... EOF` created a card whose TITLE IS THE
  LITERAL STRING `--stdin`, and threw the real title away. Exit 0, a full JSON card body
  echoed back, nothing wrong-looking. The identical command an hour earlier had worked
  and printed `DESKT-21 -> todo`.
  Cause: there are TWO amux CLIs on this machine.
    ~/.local/bin/amux -> ~/Dev/amux/amux   (live, tracks the repo, 89 stdin refs)
    /usr/local/bin/amux                     (standalone POSIX-sh copy, dated Aug 6, NO
                                             --stdin support anywhere in it)
  Default login PATH has ~/.local/bin at position 1, so normally you get the live one.
  I had prepended `/usr/local/bin` to PATH for an unrelated reason (`networksetup` and
  `ifconfig` are not on the sandboxed default PATH), which silently swapped the CLI
  under me mid-session. The two calls in this transcript differ ONLY in PATH order.
  The output shape is the tell nobody would think to look at: the live CLI prints
  `DESKT-21 -> todo`, the stale one dumps raw JSON. Same verb, same flags, same exit code.
COST: one card created with a garbage title and its real title destroyed, caught only
  because I re-read the card afterwards to get its ID. Worse than the lost title: the
  global CLAUDE.md mandates `--stdin` as the FLEET CONVENTION specifically to stop the
  shell evaluating backticks and $(...) in titles (AMUX-1888 — a garbled message, a
  leaked credential, and a stray `git rebase --quit`). On the stale CLI that mandated
  form silently discards your text, and the natural recovery is to fall back to inline
  quoting, which walks straight back into AMUX-1888. The safety convention degrades into
  the hazard it was written to prevent, with no error at any step. That is the
  AMUX-2140 shape: following the sanctioned instruction exactly is what produces the
  failure, and it returns success.
FIX: remove /usr/local/bin/amux — install.sh owns ~/.local/bin and nothing should be
  shipping a second copy to /usr/local/bin. Belt and braces, since a stale copy can
  reappear: have `amux` print its own resolved path and repo sha on any parse error, and
  make an unrecognised leading `--flag` on `board add` a hard error rather than a title.
  A CLI that accepts an unknown flag AS DATA cannot fail loudly, which is why 17 days of
  drift produced no signal.

## A shared checkout has ONE git index, so a peer's `git commit` shipped MY staged work under THEIR message
AREA: attribution
SEVERITY: blocks
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-23
SESSION: desktop
CARD: DESKT-22
SYMPTOM: I staged four files for DESKT-22 (`git add` of a migration, heartbeat.rs,
  health.rs, migrate.rs), then ran `git commit -m ...`. It died with
  `fatal: cannot lock ref 'HEAD': is at c8272bf17 but expected 78b77653b`. My commit
  never existed. But the worktree was CLEAN afterwards and my code was in HEAD anyway:
  peer session `amux` had committed in the same instant, and because a shared checkout
  has ONE index, their commit swept my four staged files in. c8272bf1 now reads
  "fix(push-guard): the consent exit now works for ISOLATED workers (AMUX-3533)" and
  contains 330 lines of unrelated downtime-cause instrumentation alongside their two
  scripts/ files. Neither author reviewed the other's half.
  Two things made it worse than a merge collision:
  1. THE TRAILER LIED, and it is the exact field the deploy recipe says to trust.
     CLAUDE.md's push section says `%an` is shared by every session so "the Amux-Session
     trailer, stamped by prepare-commit-msg, is the real discriminator". c8272bf1 is
     trailered `Amux-Session: desktop` — ME — while its `Claude-Session:` URL is a
     different agent session from mine, and the card it names (AMUX-3533) is owned by
     session `amux` on the board. The same peer's other commit that hour
     (78b77653) is correctly trailered `amux`. So the one anti-footgun the docs point
     you at reported the sweeping commit as mine.
  2. THE STAGED-GUARD WARNED IN THE WRONG DIRECTION. It fired four notices, each saying
     my files "were also edited by session 'amux' N minutes ago — if that is MORE than
     you wrote, their work is in it". That is the mirror of what was about to happen:
     the risk was MY work landing in THEIRS, and the guard has no phrasing for it. It
     even appended the AMUX-3497 caveat suggesting the co-edit signal was probably just
     my own writes seen twice, which is the reading that makes you proceed.
COST: my work is merged and correct but permanently uncitable — DESKT-22 has no commit
  of its own, and the card now carries a paragraph explaining why anyone looking for one
  will not find it. A reviewer of AMUX-3533 gets 330 unrelated lines. Not fixable after
  the fact: rewriting shared history to separate them is strictly worse than a wrong
  message. Roughly 20 minutes to establish what had happened, because every obvious
  signal (clean tree, code present in HEAD, my own session on the trailer) said the
  commit was mine.
FIX: the index is the shared resource nobody is arbitrating. Either (a) take a lock
  around stage+commit so the pair is atomic across sessions — the staged-guard already
  runs at exactly the right moment and already knows who else is live, so it is the
  natural place, or (b) stop sharing the index: per-session worktrees (`git worktree`)
  give each lane its own index and HEAD against one object store, which is the durable
  answer and kills the whole class including the documented mirror cases (a peer's
  `git pull --rebase` replaying unpushed work, 2026-08-03; a peer's commit sweeping
  staged deletions, 2026-08-09 — this file's third entry in that family).
  Separately and cheaply: prepare-commit-msg must stamp the session of the process
  actually running git, and the staged-guard must warn in BOTH directions — "your
  staged files may ride out under someone else's commit" is the half it cannot say.

## A detector went fully inert and its own debug surface called it "baseline has 0 samples"
AREA: instruments
SEVERITY: slows
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-23
SESSION: amux-frustrations
CARD: AF-178
SYMPTOM: Reviewing AF-175 I found the latency regression detector had stopped working on the
  running build. The only trace anywhere was in GET /api/debug/autofix:
    {"detector":"latency","signature":"latency|p95|/api/board",
     "reason":"baseline has 0 samples (<30) - no trailing norm to compare against yet"}
  /api/board has 46,825 rows in the baseline period and /api/sessions has 122,848. They are the
  two busiest families in the system. An upstream filter was excluding 99.75% of rows (213,397
  of 213,935) and the suppression reported that as an absence of data. The same sentence is
  emitted for a genuinely quiet endpoint, so a live detector outage is byte-identical to a new
  install with no traffic yet.
COST: The regression shape was dead on main and would have stayed dead silently. I only found
  it because I was reviewing that specific commit; no sweep, no alarm and no invariant could
  have surfaced it. Checked from two angles before saying so: /api/debug/invariants returns 461
  invariants and the only autofix-adjacent one is board.autofix_cards_are_dispatchable, and in
  the source base.len() is compared in exactly one place, the min_samples gate that produces
  the suppression. Detector health is not checked anywhere.
FIX: Carry the pre-filter row count into the suppression so "0 of 46,825 rows, all filtered"
  cannot be confused with "0 rows in the period", and add an invariant that fails when a family
  with enough rows in the period has an empty baseline. Both values are already in hand at the
  point of suppression. Detail and acceptance on AF-178.

## The staged guard named me as co-editor of a file I never opened
AREA: attribution
SEVERITY: slows
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-23
SESSION: amux-frustrations
CARD: AF-179
SYMPTOM: amux committed scripts/token-baseline.py, a file they created from scratch, and the
  staged guard told them "was also edited by session 'amux-frustrations' 6m ago. This commit
  stages 595 insertions / 0 deletions there". I never opened it. The mechanism is
  observed-edits-post.py walking everything under cwd and reporting each file whose mtime is
  >= a marker stamped when the Bash command started: the window is the DURATION of the
  command, so on a shared checkout every peer write inside it becomes mine. I was running a
  `cargo test` that took two minutes; the file's mtime is 20:10, inside it, and the guard's
  "6m ago" matches that mtime exactly.
COST: A round trip with amux that neither of us could resolve from the output, because nothing
  in the guard's sentence says the claim came from an mtime window rather than a write. They
  had to ask whether their commit had silently clobbered work of mine. The direction that costs
  more is the inverse: a session recognising the shape of a false warning and pushing through a
  true one.
FIX: Record and print the METHOD and WINDOW on an observed record ("observed via a 128s mtime
  window during `cargo test`") instead of the bare "was also edited by". Stop ranking a
  wide-window observed record equal to a firsthand write. And log WHICH paths were sent: the
  hook log says `n=3 sent` and not what, so the log built to verify the hook by what it wrote
  cannot say what it claimed. AF-179.
NOTE: AF-124 fixed the read-only half of this class (a `cat` of a peer's file no longer claims
  it); no command-level allowlist can reach this half, because the commands that open the widest
  windows are the ones that genuinely write. AMUX-3497 already ships a caveat for it and that
  caveat FIRED for me tonight on a different file in the same commit run, so this entry is
  narrower than it first reads: it is live only if the caveat did NOT print for amux on
  token-baseline.py. Asked; holding. What survives either way is the log line, which records
  `n=3 sent` and not which three.

## An autofix card was dispatched for an incident that had already self-resolved
AREA: instruments
SEVERITY: slows
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-23
SESSION: amux
CARD: AMUX-3572
SYMPTOM: AMUX-3572 was auto-picked-up and handed to me as live work: "Invariant
  `queue.has_live_consumer` has been failing for amux across 629 evaluations and has not
  self-healed." The incident row said otherwise. `_amux_invariant_incident` for
  (queue.has_live_consumer, amux) read `status=pass, resolved_at=1787530412`, which is
  2026-08-23 20:33 — roughly a minute BEFORE the pickup notice reached me. The card's text
  and the store disagreed about the present tense, and only the card was delivered.
COST: A full investigation of a healed incident. I read the check, the monitor, the filer and
  the incident table, and formed and killed two hypotheses, before establishing that the thing
  I was sent to diagnose had stopped happening before I was asked. The card does carry a
  re-check recipe and it is the first thing I ran, but it queries `/api/health/invariants`,
  which reports FAILURES ONLY — so a resolved incident and an invariant that was never
  evaluated return the identical empty result, and the recipe cannot distinguish "fixed" from
  "absent". Establishing it had genuinely resolved needed `/api/debug/invariants` plus a direct
  read of the incident table, neither of which the card names.
FIX: The filer already writes `resolved_at` on the incident row. When an incident resolves,
  say so on the card it minted: annotate it, or move it out of the pickup queue, or at minimum
  have the pickup notice read the incident's CURRENT status rather than the text frozen at
  filing time. And point the card's re-check recipe at `/api/debug/invariants`
  (`latest_per_invariant`), which is the only surface where a PASS is visible — a re-check that
  cannot tell green from absent is the ethos rule 7 shape, embedded in the remediation advice
  itself.
NOTE: The underlying false positive IS fixed at the root (95d97a8e): the check's `expected`
  string promised "within 300s of the target going idle" while the code measured
  `now - queued_at`, so any lane with turns over 300s tripped it at every busy->idle transition
  and cleared seconds later. That is what generated 629 occurrences. This entry is the OTHER
  half and is not fixed: a card outliving its incident is independent of which detector filed
  it, and the next self-healing incident will be dispatched exactly the same way.

## A peer's uncommitted lint error blocked my commit and the message named their file, not them
AREA: gates
SEVERITY: blocks
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-23
SESSION: amux-frustrations
CARD: AF-182
SYMPTOM: The pre-commit gate runs `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets` over the WORKING
  TREE, not over what is staged. My commit of two clean files was refused with
  `board_drive.rs:3620 this assertion has a constant value`, from 170 uncommitted lines of a
  peer's in-flight work. Nothing in the output said the file was not mine. Earlier the same
  hour, `cargo check` failed on `missing field idle_since in initializer of QueuedItem` from
  the same peer writing checks.rs and monitor.rs minutes apart, and I built inside the window.
COST: A commit blocked outright with no correct action available except waiting on another
  session, plus a rebuild and a spell of doubting my own edits on the earlier one. The tempting
  wrong move is cheap and available: fix the peer's file. That is how a session ends up
  committing another session's half-finished work, which is the class the staged guard exists
  to prevent, reached from a direction the staged guard cannot see.
FIX: amux's framing, which is better than my first one: the gate reports a WORKSPACE-SCOPED
  FACT IN A SESSION-SCOPED SENTENCE. The diagnostic is true about the repo and false about the
  committer and nothing says which was meant. The gate already holds both halves at the moment
  it refuses (the staged pathspec, and the file each diagnostic names), so the discriminator is
  a set membership test. Say "BLOCKED BY ANOTHER SESSION'S IN-FLIGHT WORK - not your commit",
  name the session and that the staged files are clean, and carry the COUNT, because "1 of 1 is
  not yours" and "3 of 4 are yours" are different situations and the second must not read as
  exonerating. AF-182.
NOTE: third instance of one shape in about an hour, with AF-179 (a peer's Bash window sampled
  my ongoing authorship, reported as "you edited this") and the transient unbuildable window
  amux is filing separately. All three are a true statement about the shared checkout delivered
  in the second person.

## A multi-file change is transiently unbuildable for every OTHER session, not just its author
AREA: attribution
SEVERITY: slows
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-23
SESSION: amux
CARD: AF-182
SYMPTOM: Adding a field to `QueuedItem` in checks.rs and populating it in monitor.rs is one
  logical change across two files. Between my two writes the shared checkout did not compile,
  and a peer hit `missing field idle_since in initializer of QueuedItem` at monitor.rs:832 —
  a file and a struct they had never touched. Twice in one hour, in the other direction too:
  my in-flight clippy error in board_drive.rs:3620 refused THEIR commit, because the
  pre-commit gate lints the whole workspace while the commit itself is a pathspec.
COST: Two round trips between sessions, each opening with a version of "is this mine?". Both
  of us guessed right, and both had to ask. The expensive direction is the inverse and has not
  happened yet: a session that has learned this shape recognising a REAL breakage of its own as
  somebody else's dirt and pushing through it.
FIX: AF-182's proposal is the right one and amux-frustrations owns it — the gate already knows
  both the staged pathspec and the file each diagnostic names, so telling them apart is a set
  membership test, not new machinery. Beyond the wording, carry the COUNT: "1 of 1 offending
  files is not yours" and "3 of 4 are yours" are different situations and the second must not
  read as exonerating. My half of the remedy needs no code: keep a multi-file struct change
  inside a single write window so the unbuildable interval never spans a peer's build.
NOTE: The root is shared by AF-179 and this entry, which is why it is filed under the same AREA
  rather than as `gates`. In all three cases amux stated something TRUE ABOUT THE SHARED
  CHECKOUT in a sentence scoped to the reader — "was also edited by you", "your commit is
  refused" — and the reader has no way to recover which was meant. The lint scope and the mtime
  window are two instruments making the same category error.

## The browser guard is absent against the one lane the dashboard is hardcoded to impersonate
AREA: attribution
SEVERITY: blocks
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-23
SESSION: amux-frustrations
CARD: AF-183
SYMPTOM: A session is handed "a browser is already running under session '(unattributed)' —
  starting yours would DESTROY its state (staged logins included)". It names no owner, so there
  is nobody to ask and the only safe move is to do nothing. Measured: 451 of 535
  /api/browser/start rows all-time (84%) carry no X-Amux-Session, so the guard's whole safety
  property, naming the owner you are about to destroy, is unavailable for most collisions.
  Worse, app.js:32951 hardcodes `let _bwSession = 'amux'` with the deeplink as its only setter,
  so a browser a human opens from the Browser tab is recorded as owned by the `amux` LANE. The
  guard's same-session shortcut then treats that lane's start as the human's own restart:
  no refusal, no takeover flag, staged logins gone.
COST: A blocked browser for whoever hits the refusal, and a live path for an agent to silently
  destroy a human's signed-in session. The text is also verbatim the text of AF-181, an
  auto-captured card that was DISCARDED and then folded into an unrelated card, so it recurs
  and the discard is what let it recur.
FIX: Put the recoverable facts in the SENTENCE (pid, started_at, profile are already in the
  body but not the string) and let the refusal consult _amux_request_log for the start row, so
  "started 10h ago from 127.0.0.1 by curl/8.7.1" replaces "(unattributed)". Separately, and
  routed to Ethan because it is an identity decision, the dashboard must stop calling itself
  `amux`. AF-183.
NOTE: this is AMUX-1768's class one layer up. browser.rs:104-113 removed the SERVER-side default
  constant in writing, for exactly this reason ("framing that lane for every anonymous call ...
  and worse, the guard's same-session shortcut let any TWO anonymous callers stomp each other").
  The client-side constant survived the fix. Fourth member of the 2026-08-23 misattribution
  cluster with AF-179 and AF-182; the other three name a WRONG owner, which is recoverable, and
  this one names none.
STATUS-2026-09-01: HALF SHIPPED, and the half that is left is not code. The
  request-log lookup this entry asks for EXISTS and is wired: api/browser.rs
  carries `StartOrigin` with three states (Found / NotFound / NotLooked, so "we
  looked and found nothing" cannot collapse into "we did not look"),
  `lookup_start_origin` reads client_ip and user_agent off `_amux_request_log`,
  and the refusal consults it. So the caller now gets "127.0.0.1 + curl/8.7.1" or
  "100.66.26.84 + Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh...)" instead of "(unattributed)", which
  is the discrimination the COST line names: an agent on this box against a human
  at a browser.
  The TITLE's claim is still true. `let _bwSession = 'amux';` is live at
  app.js:34858, so a browser a human opens from the Browser tab is still recorded
  as owned by the `amux` LANE, and the guard's same-session shortcut still treats
  that lane's start as the human's own restart. The entry stays open on that
  clause alone.
  Not fixable from here without deciding what the dashboard should call itself,
  which is whose identity it is (ethos rule 8). AF-183 is in `needsyou` with the
  question in one sentence and a recommendation.

## A peer's mid-edit fails MY test run, and a rerun is the only way to tell
AREA: attribution
SEVERITY: slows
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-24
SESSION: amux
CARD: AF-182
SYMPTOM: `cargo test -p amux-server --lib` returned "1284 passed; 1 failed" twice tonight,
  hours apart, and BOTH times the failure vanished on an immediate rerun with no change to my
  tree (1282/0, then 1285/0). The suite prints the count in the tail but the failing test name
  scrolls past in ~1290 lines, so the first thing you see is a number, not a name. On the
  second occurrence I read the tail, saw the count, and committed and pushed before registering
  the `1 failed` beside it.
COST: A commit message (d237f886) that states "1284 lib tests" for a run that was not clean.
  Caught and corrected on the card within minutes, but the message is pushed and wrong, and the
  correction lives somewhere the next reader of that commit will not look. The expensive
  direction has not happened yet: a session learning this shape and re-running past a REAL
  failure because "it is probably a peer".
FIX: The shipped half of AF-182 — lint-blame partitioning offenders into yours / a peer's
  in-flight work / already-broken-on-HEAD — is exactly the discriminator this needs, and it
  currently runs only in the pre-commit hook. A `scripts/cargo-blame.sh test` wrapper that pipes
  a failing run through the same analysis with STAGED empty would answer "is this mine" in one
  line instead of a rerun. amux-frustrations proposed that wrapper for `check`/`clippy`; this is
  the same gap for `test`, and the test case is worse because the signal is a count rather than
  a compiler error naming a file.
NOTE: This is the transient-unbuildable half of AF-182 that I own, showing up in a form I had
  not predicted. My entry there described the window as breaking a peer's BUILD. It also breaks
  a peer's TEST RUN, where there is no filename in the output to attribute — you get an
  arithmetic difference between two numbers and no clue whose edit caused it. e6077bcb fixed the
  commit path; neither of us has fixed the ad-hoc path, and this is the second cost from it.

## Discarding a spurious autofix card refiles it, so doing the right thing loops
AREA: board
SEVERITY: slows
STATUS: fixed
DATE: 2026-08-24
SESSION: amux
CARD: AMUX-3591
SYMPTOM: One server hang filed the identical card four times — AMUX-3581 (01:12), 3589 (01:26),
  3591 (01:35), 3594 (01:55) — same signature byte for byte, same 19 rows, zero new information.
  Each filing was triggered by the previous one being DISCARDED. Discarding an auto-filed report
  deletes its dedupe idem to re-arm the detector (board.rs, AF-137), which is correct for a
  CONDITION whose refile should require the condition to be live again. The 5xx signature carried
  no occurrence identity, so "recurrence" meant "any 5xx on that path still inside the 6h window"
  and the same historical rows kept qualifying.
COST: Four lane-turns, three of them mine, each a full scope-and-decide cycle on a card that was
  never a defect. Worse than the count: every round was a worker doing exactly the right thing.
  Judging a spurious report and discarding it is the sanctioned disposition, and it was the thing
  driving the loop.
FIX: 01b4cf53 — occurrence identity in the 5xx signature plus `5xx|` added to the re-arm skip,
  mirroring what AMUX-3472 already did for latency outliers. Same rows re-scanned now mint the
  same signature; a genuinely new 5xx mints a new one and files regardless, pinned by a control
  so this does not trade a refile loop for a detector that goes silent after one discard.
NOTE: Two things worth more than the bug. First, I diagnosed it WRONG twice — assumed discard
  caused it, then talked myself out of it because `already_filed` reads a durable idem and never
  checks card status, and wrote that up as a dead hypothesis. Both readings missed that the
  discard does not bypass the dedupe, it DELETES it, in a file I had not grepped. The comment
  naming the hook was in code I had already read that night (autofix.rs:1185). It took a THIRD
  filing to make me look instead of reason. Second, the correct DISPOSITION changed with the
  deploy state: with the fix merged but not running (builder dead since 00:01, AMUX-3585),
  discarding still loops, so AMUX-3594 was closed `done` instead — the re-arm hook fires only on
  the discard transition. Nothing in the card, the gate or the idle nudge can tell you that, and
  the nudge's own option 5 recommends the action that restarts the loop.

## A migration's COST is invisible to the TEST SUITE: four fixture rows make a table scan and an index scan identical
AREA: instruments
SEVERITY: blocks
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-24
SESSION: amux
CARD: AMUX-3609 (logs half, done) / AF-193 (suite half, open)
NARROWED: 2026-08-24 under AF-191, at the AUTHOR's explicit request, not by a third party.
  amux: "HALF GONE and I want to be precise. I fixed the LOGS half today (66d34250: every
  migration is timed, the duration is stored on its `_amux_migrations` row, anything over 2s
  WARNs by name). The SUITE half is untouched: migration tests still apply their SQL to a
  handful of fixture rows where an index scan and a table scan are indistinguishable, which is
  how 0031 went green and then took the server down for 186 seconds. Do not delete this entry.
  Narrow it to the suite half, or split it."
  The FIX paragraph below is left verbatim and describes what SHIPPED. What remains is the
  suite, on AF-193. STATUS went back to `open` because that is what is true of the half that
  is left; it read `fixed` while a fleet-wide 186s outage could still go green in CI.
SYMPTOM: Migration 0031 backfilled `issues.closed_at` from `_amux_state_events` with a
  correlated subquery. `_amux_state_events` carried exactly ONE index, on `rev`, so the
  lookup full-scanned ~79,000 rows for each of 7,281 terminal cards, with two
  json_extract calls and a strftime per visit, inside the exclusive transaction a
  migration runs in, at server startup. /health returned nothing for 186 seconds. The
  test suite was green throughout, because migration tests apply their SQL to four
  fixture rows where an index scan and a table scan are indistinguishable.
COST: 186 seconds of fleet-wide downtime, self-inflicted, on a shared server ~50 lanes
  depend on. Every session's `curl $AMUX_URL/...` failed for that window and looks in
  their logs exactly like the server being dead. Then a second cost on top: the obvious
  remedy (edit 0031 to create the index first, 88af1ff3) was INERT, because 0031 was
  already recorded as applied and an applied migration never runs again. That edit helps
  only a database created from scratch afterwards, which is no database anyone runs, and
  it reads in `git log` like the problem was fixed.
  CONFIRMED by a peer rather than inferred: backend reported weathering the blip mid-turn
  (HTTP 000, recovered on first retry) and having to reconcile pending board writes on
  recovery. No data lost, but a peer paid for it and had no way to know why.
FIX: 66d34250. Two halves. (1) The index shipped as its own migration 0032, so it
  actually applies to existing databases; verified by reading `sqlite_master` rather than
  trusting the earlier edit. (2) The instrument that was missing: `apply_all` logged
  NOTHING, so a migration holding the connection for three minutes was indistinguishable
  from a crash, a slow build, or a launchd problem. Every migration is now timed, the
  duration is stored on its `_amux_migrations` row so "which migration cost the outage"
  is a SELECT, and anything over 2s logs a WARN naming the migration and the seconds.
NOTE: The generalisable part is not "index your subqueries". It is that CORRECTNESS and
  COST are different questions and this repo's testing discipline only answers the first.
  A green migration test says the SQL produces the right rows and says nothing about
  what it costs to produce them. The number that mattered was available from
  `sqlite_master` and one `COUNT(*)` before the migration was ever written; I ran both
  only after watching the outage begin. For any migration that touches the live board,
  the cheap precondition is: how many rows does this scan, and is there an index for the
  predicate it scans on.

## A commit that compiles in the author's tree can be unbuildable AS A COMMIT
AREA: gates
SEVERITY: blocks
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-24
SESSION: amux-frustrations
CARD: AF-190
SYMPTOM: My 53ae4b8b was the tip of origin/main and did not compile. Staging
  crates/amux-server/src/api/board.rs took ~16 lines of a peer's in-flight AMUX-3607 wiring that
  were sitting in the same FILE, including a call to `effective_gate_trail` whose definition was
  in board_store.rs — still uncommitted in their tree, so not in mine.
  `git show 53ae4b8b:crates/amux-server/src/db/board_store.rs | grep -c effective_gate_trail` -> 0,
  while board.rs at that same commit calls it. Main was unbuildable until their f5c6af76 landed.
COST: A broken tip on origin/main. CI runs per-tip so it went green, but a bisect through that
  range still breaks, and per-commit CI would have gone red on someone else's PR. My clean local
  `cargo check` and the pre-commit gate both passed, correctly: they check the TREE, which
  contained the peer's definition. Nothing anywhere builds the COMMIT.
FIX: The pathspec form CLAUDE.md mandates does not reach this — the peer's work was in the same
  file as mine, so file-granular staging takes it regardless. Two things that would:
  (a) The staged-guard already knows both facts it needs. It told me "34 insertions / 9 deletions
      — if that is MORE than you wrote, their work is in it", and 5 of those 34 were the peer's.
      It could also say: "you are committing board.rs, which a peer co-edited, and board_store.rs
      is DIRTY and NOT in this commit" — a staged/dirty cross-reference, from data it already has.
  (b) Build the COMMIT rather than the tree: a detached worktree at HEAD with its own target
      dir, checked before the commit is pushed. MEASURED rather than guessed — 40.6s on the next
      commit (be397da2), not the cold build I first wrote here, because cargo keys on content and
      the dependency tree is unchanged between commits.
  (a) is instant and names the hazard in words; (b) is the only thing that PROVES it. Not
  alternatives: do (a) first, and make (b) opt-in (AMUX_VERIFY_COMMIT=1) before it is a default,
  since the pre-commit gate already pays ~14s for clippy and this roughly triples it.
NOTE: the instrument was RIGHT and I read past it. The guard printed the insertion count and the
  exact question, and the number looked about right for my change so I did not reconcile it.
  Third time today I have named the confirming-result blind spot and the first time it shipped
  something. Same axis as amux's migration-cost entry: our discipline answers CORRECTNESS and
  does not answer WHAT ACTUALLY SHIPS.
## The disk ranker cannot rank a file, so it could never have named the 1.8 GB one
AREA: instruments
SEVERITY: slows
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-22
SESSION: amux-errors-and-bugs
CARD: AEAB-42
SYMPTOM: `disk_candidates()` pushes only entries where `metadata().is_dir()`. Its own
  cache, `~/.amux/du-sizes.json`, holds 26 entries and all 26 are directories. `amux.db`
  would rank fourth, above `~/.claude`, and is absent.
COST: the report meant to say what is eating the volume pointed at ~/Library/Caches,
  ~/.npm and ~/.cache while the fourth-largest object was amux's own database — for as
  long as that database has existed. I only found it by running dbstat by hand.
FIX: push regular files over a size floor from the same read_dir passes; the size is
  already in the metadata so there is no extra du cost. The lesson worth keeping: AEAB-33
  taught the ranking to declare the candidates it FAILED on, and that warning can never
  declare candidates it never GENERATED — after adding a surfacing mechanism, ask what
  the mechanism itself cannot express.

## I fixed the inner loop of a noisy warning and left the outer one, at 77% of the log
AREA: instruments
SEVERITY: slows
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-22
SESSION: amux-errors-and-bugs
CARD: AEAB-45
SYMPTOM: 1,336 of 1,726 lines in the 24h window are one sentence naming `~/.Trash
  (du exit 1)`, a condition that cannot change, emitted every autofix tick on each of two
  servers. I wrote it in AEAB-33, and its own comment says it now fires "ONCE per run ...
  rather than once per attempt" because the per-attempt spelling "drowned the log it
  shares with real faults".
COST: it competed for attention with three real findings in the same window (AEAB-41,
  AEAB-42, AEAB-43). AEAB-13 recorded the identical shape at the identical ratio — 921 of
  1004 lines — where it buried a first-ever `database is locked` line during a log review
  that existed to find exactly that.
FIX: reuse AEAB-13's tested `stall_log_first_this_bucket` rather than writing a second
  spelling of it, keyed on the joined path list so a CHANGED skip set still logs
  immediately. The pattern: a per-run dedupe is not a dedupe if the run is on a timer.

## Two servers on one DB reap each other's live work and halve each other's thresholds
AREA: instruments
SEVERITY: slows
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-22
SESSION: amux-errors-and-bugs
CARD: AEAB-43
SYMPTOM: `reap_orphaned_scans` runs `UPDATE reclaim_scans SET status='interrupted',
  error='server restarted mid-scan; the scan thread did not survive' WHERE
  status='running'` — no owner on the row. 8824 boots 10s after 8823 and reaps 8823's
  healthy scan. Both of the two scans that have ever run say the thread did not survive;
  both threads logged progress five minutes later, with no restart. And because every
  terminal write is guarded `AND status='running'`, the true outcome can never be
  recorded afterwards — it matches zero rows and logs nothing.
  Separately: `reclaim_skipped` shows ~/Downloads at hits=2 with first_seen and last_seen
  NINE SECONDS apart, so a threshold documented as "needs 2 such scans" was satisfied by
  one incident counted twice, and ~/Downloads is now permanently skipped.
COST: 2 of 2 reclaim scans ever run carry a false cause, on the machine where disk is the
  live risk. Any hits-based threshold in amux is silently halved the same way.
FIX: an owner column (pid or per-process boot ulid) on the scan row, reaping only rows
  whose owner is neither this process nor a live pid. The general form, which is the
  third entry this week under AEAB-11: any predicate that means "mine" or "twice" is
  wrong on a shared DB with two writers, and the failures do not look alike from outside.

## A green test suite EXPIRES through the shared index, and the commit ships red
AREA: attribution
SEVERITY: blocks
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-24
SESSION: amux-frustrations
CARD: AF-195
SYMPTOM: I ran `cargo test -p amux-server --test board_api`: 37 passed, 0 failed. I committed.
  c971756b shipped RED. Its message says "Both numeric floors are gone" and its diff adds one
  back: `!lines.any(|l| new.contains(l)) && old.chars()...saturating_sub(...) >= 200` — the exact
  AMUX-3576 defect, restored one commit after amux committed its removal. amux ran the same suite
  minutes later and got board_api.rs:2280, left 200 right 409. BOTH RESULTS WERE TRUE when taken.
  The floor arrived through the index between my run and my commit.
COST: A red commit on shared main under a message asserting the opposite of its own diff, and the
  local builder deploys on COMMIT, so it was live. Fixed forward in c4ba5096. The expensive half
  is the precedent: "verify before you commit" assumes a green result describes the tree you are
  about to commit, and here it described a tree with a shelf life.
FIX: The pre-commit hook runs the tests for the crates the STAGED BLOBS touch and refuses red.
  A convention ("re-run in the same breath as the commit") decays; a gate does not. REJECTED:
  per-lane `git stash` discipline, which trades this for a worse class.
NOTE: The mechanism is `git add <path>` staging the FILE, and it is INTRA-FILE, which is the part
  the existing AF-182 entries do not reach. ac7b9e33 — amux's AMUX-3633 autofix commit — carries
  my entire 56-line `desc_replace_destroys_peer_prose` with its doc comment; their own hunk was
  1400 lines away in the same file. `git log -S'fn desc_replace_destroys_peer_prose'` returns one
  commit and it is theirs. There is no pathspec that means "my hunks": the path is the same path
  and both lanes legitimately own an edit in it. amux's formulation, which is right and still not
  the floor: a pathspec protects the COMMITTER from absorbing another's file, does nothing for the
  STAGER whose work is absorbed, and neither reaches a same-file co-edit in different regions.
  Instance five today, and the first to cost a red commit. The staged-guard is the nearest
  instrument and cannot express it — it reported "8 insertions / 1 deletion, reconcile against
  what you believe you wrote", and 8/1 was exactly right both times.

## A rejected review has no status, so the reviewer is nudged to review their own rejection
AREA: board
SEVERITY: annoys
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-24
SESSION: amux (hit it, twice), amux-frustrations (verified the mechanism)
CARD: AF-214 (nudge skip, done) / AMUX-3668 (the `changes-requested` status, open)
SYMPTOM: amux reviewed AF-203, rejected it with four specifics, and was re-nudged twice with
  "[amux] AF-203 sits in 'review' and names YOU as reviewer". The nudge predicate
  (board_drive.rs:2461) is `status == review AND reviewer == you`, and its own instruction —
  "if not, say what fails on the card" — is a DESC write that does not change status. So
  following it exactly leaves the card in the state that re-fires the nudge, until the 24h
  budget is spent. Verified against the running board: the status vocabulary is backlog, todo,
  doing, review, done, verified, discarded. There is no cell for "reviewed, rejected, back with
  the author", so both honest-looking moves misdescribe reality — `review` claims it awaits a
  REVIEWER when it awaits the AUTHOR, and `doing` reads as the reviewer working it when the
  reviewer is finished.
COST: two wasted reviewer turns on one card, each a full re-read to conclude "I already did
  this". Small per instance and it recurs on every rejected review. The larger cost is the
  board lying to every reader until the author notices: a card in `review` is indistinguishable
  from one nobody has looked at yet.
FIX: a `changes-requested` status (or `review` + a `rejected` flag) — it is the true state, it
  removes the card from the reviewer-nudge predicate, and it returns the card to the AUTHOR's
  queue where the work is. Cheaper fallback if that is too much surface: skip the reviewer
  nudge when the card's most recent activity is the REVIEWER's own note, since they have
  demonstrably reviewed it. REJECTED: raising the nudge budget — that makes an uninformative
  nudge fire less often, which is not the same as making it informative.
NOTE: amux's own move was the correct read and the vocabulary still could not hold it: "Not a
  second review — my findings stand... this is a status correction so the card stops describing
  itself as awaiting a reviewer when what it awaits is four small edits by its author." This is
  the AMUX-2140 shape (the sanctioned instruction does not reach an exit) in the review loop
  rather than the CLI.

NARROWED 2026-08-24 to the VOCABULARY half. The re-nag is fixed; the lying status is not.
  SHIPPED (c98ac2c1, AF-214): the reviewer nudge now skips a card whose reviewer has written
  to it since it entered review. amux verified independently — always-return-true reddens 3 of
  5 cells, dropping the round scoping reddens the resubmit cell alone, both counts as claimed.
  They also checked the NEEDLE against AF-203's real stored log rather than a fixture, which
  is the check that matters since a matcher that never matches makes the whole thing inert
  while every test passes: "` amux:" matches the reviewer's own desc row and does NOT match
  `amux-frustrations:` (the trailing colon anchors it), `authz:`, or `commit <sha> —`. And the
  skip is legible in the drive's own output as `Advance::None { reason: "reviewer-already-acted" }`
  rather than a silent no-op, because a nudge that stops firing and one that was never
  eligible look identical from outside.
  STILL OPEN, and it is the half that fixes the class: there is no status for "reviewed,
  rejected, back with the author". `review` claims the card awaits a REVIEWER when it awaits
  the AUTHOR; `doing` reads as the reviewer working it when they are finished. amux has taken
  it as AMUX-3668 (board_drive is theirs and they are the one who hit it), going with
  preference (a), a `changes-requested` status.
  WORTH KEEPING, amux's own: their first mutation pass reported BOTH mutations surviving,
  because they filtered `cargo test -- a_reviewer_who_has_written` and matched one cell of
  five. Naming the target before searching for it — the same instrument error this entry is
  about, made while checking the fix for it.

## The board's slim list omits six fields and only two of them say so
AREA: instruments
SEVERITY: slows
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-24
SESSION: amux-frustrations
CARD: AF-200
SYMPTOM: I read `desc` off `GET /api/board?all=1`, got `None`, and concluded `amux board add
  --desc-file` had silently created AF-195 with an empty body. It had not: the card carried 1809
  characters the whole time. The list payload has no `desc` key at all. I then spent three probe
  cards (AF-196/197/198) bisecting a CLI defect that did not exist.
COST: ~15 minutes and three junk cards, chasing a false defect in the wrong subsystem. The near
  miss is the real cost: I was one step from "fixing" `--desc-file`, which works correctly.
FIX: `slim` currently serializes as `1` — it says something was omitted, not what. Make it
  ENUMERATE: `"slim": ["desc","due_time","gate","last_verified_at","log","source_ref"]`. Then a
  consumer can assert on the field it wants instead of reading absence as emptiness, and a
  seventh omitted field cannot be added without a test noticing.
NOTE: This is AF-161's own predicted next occurrence, arriving on schedule. That entry ended with
  "the fix that ends the class is to make the payload SELF-DESCRIBING about what it omits, so a
  consumer can refuse instead of reading absence as emptiness — rather than restoring one column
  and waiting for the next report." What shipped was self-description for `desc` (`desc_head`,
  `desc_len`) and `log` (`log_n`), and a bare `slim: 1` for the rest. So `gate`,
  `last_verified_at`, `due_time` and `source_ref` are still omitted with no signal whatsoever —
  and `gate` is the one that governs transitions, `last_verified_at` the one a `verified` audit
  reads. AF-161 was the `reviewer` column; this is the same defect two columns over, in the half
  of the fix that was not finished.

## Worker session does not auto-restart when server restarts
AREA: instruments
SEVERITY: blocks
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-29
SESSION: 6527367a-8ff6-431a-ace9-e421554fb30d
CARD: none
SYMPTOM: After `systemctl --user restart amux.service` (from a deployment), the amux
  worker session stays down: `GET /api/sessions/amux` returns `running: false`. Inbound
  Telegram messages have nowhere to route into until someone manually calls `POST
  /api/sessions/amux/start`. The `amux-worker-start.service` is a boot-time-only unit
  (runs once at `systemd --user` init), not triggered by manual server restarts.
COST: 5 minutes of diagnostics; live Telegram messages silently drop inbound until
  manually restarted. In production with unattended amux, a server restart from a
  deployment would leave Telegram routing dead until noticed and fixed manually.
FIX: Either (a) change `amux-worker-start.service` to have `Restart=always` so it
  auto-restarts with amux.service, or (b) add a post-startup hook to amux.service
  that calls `POST /api/sessions/amux/start`, or (c) wire the worker start into a
  systemd timer that verifies worker is up on server start. The root cause is that
  system-startup and service-restart are different events (both need the worker up),
  and the current unit only handles the first.

## amux.service's KillMode=mixed cgroup-kills the whole fleet on every ordinary deploy
AREA: instruments
SEVERITY: blocks
STATUS: fixed
DATE: 2026-08-30
SESSION: amux (this session, catching up on the 2026-08-29 reboot-verification memory)
CARD: INIT-1
SYMPTOM: Continuing the prior session's "verify everything comes back after reboot"
  checklist, `GET /api/sessions` showed ALL 9 registered worker sessions with
  running:false — not just after the physical reboot, but again after the routine
  08:31:39 auto-builder restart that followed (commit 251cf15b, an ordinary
  feature-branch deploy). `tmux list-sessions` had nothing but a freshly-recreated
  `amux-init`; the real tmux server that held every worker's session had been killed
  outright. Root cause: `amux.service` has `KillMode=mixed` + `SendSIGKILL=yes`, and
  the tmux server lives in that unit's cgroup (spawned by ExecStartPre, never leaves
  it — cgroup membership is sticky across reparenting to PID 1 even though tmux
  daemonizes). Every restart of amux.service — reboot OR ordinary deploy — SIGKILLs
  the whole cgroup, tmux server included. `amux-worker-start.service` only fires once
  at boot (`WantedBy=default.target`), so nothing brought sessions back afterward.
  This generalizes the narrower 2026-08-29 entry ("worker session does not auto-
  restart when server restarts", CARD: none, still open) — that one suspected a
  single worker and a single restart path; this is the whole fleet, and it fires on
  every commit-triggered deploy, which happens many times a day on an active branch.
COST: The entire fleet (9 lanes) silently down for ~1h25m (08:31 restart to 09:56
  discovery+fix) with no alert anywhere — `/health` reported "ok" the whole time,
  because the server process itself was fine; only the sessions it was supposed to
  be managing were gone. Inbound Telegram messages during that window had nowhere to
  land. A separate near-miss found along the way: `amux start <name>` (no --detach)
  silently returns exit 1 with ZERO output when it can't attach to a non-existent
  TTY, even though the start itself succeeded — first read as "start is broken",
  cost a few minutes of confusion before `--detach` runs revealed it was already
  running.
FIX: `~/.config/systemd/user/amux.service`: `KillMode=mixed` -> `KillMode=process`
  (config-only; `daemon-reload` applied without disrupting the running process —
  confirmed same PID/start-time before and after the reload). `process` mode signals
  only the unit's main PID, leaving the tmux server (and its sessions) alone —
  matching what ExecStartPre's own idempotent `has-session || new-session` check
  already assumed. VERIFIED live: `systemctl --user restart amux.service` (09:59
  UTC) — PID changed, uptime_s reset, and all 8 real worker sessions (excluding the
  separately-broken `synthesia`, wrong macOS path) kept their original tmux
  `created` timestamps and came back running:true with no manual restart needed.
  NOT YET DONE (the log-signal half, tracked on INIT-1): an `invariants/checks.rs`
  check for "session expected running (standing_orders / no recorded stop event)
  but `tmux has-session` says no" — today nothing in `runtime_jobs` would have
  caught this without a human reading the dashboard; `backend::bootstrap::Bootstrap`
  only reacts to explicit Starting/ended DB transitions, and an out-of-band cgroup
  SIGKILL produces neither.

## `amux start`/`start-all` silently die under `set -e` on a tmux target-syntax bug
AREA: cli
SEVERITY: blocks
STATUS: fixed
DATE: 2026-08-30
SESSION: amux (recovering from the KillMode incident above)
CARD: INIT-2
SYMPTOM: While recovering the fleet from the KillMode=mixed incident (previous entry),
  `amux start-all` created exactly ONE tmux session then exited 1 with NO output at
  all. `amux start <name>` on any not-yet-running session behaved the same: silent
  exit 1, session left running-but-unlocked in tmux, nothing printed. Root cause:
  `cmd_start`'s window-name lock, `tmux set-option -t "=$tname" allow-rename off
  2>/dev/null`, targets a WINDOW-scoped option with a bare session-exact-match
  target — tmux looks for a window literally named "=amux-<name>", finds none,
  exits 1 — and `set -euo pipefail` (line 19) kills the function right there, with
  the only evidence routed to `2>/dev/null` on that exact line. A second, separate
  bug compounded it: `cmd_start_all` called `cmd_start "$name"` with no `--detach`,
  so even after fixing the first bug, the first session started still hit
  `cmd_start`'s own terminal-attach step, correctly failed "open terminal failed:
  not a terminal" in this non-interactive context, and `set -e` aborted the rest of
  the loop — every session after the first silently stayed down.
COST: `amux start-all` — the obvious, documented recovery command for "the whole
  fleet is down" (INIT-1) — was silently non-functional for that exact use case.
  Cost ~15 minutes of manual per-session `amux start <name> --detach` calls to
  actually recover the fleet before this was root-caused, and would cost the same
  to the next session (or the next reboot) that reaches for `start-all` expecting
  it to work.
FIX: `amux` (ships on save, already live): `-t "=$tname"` ->
  `-t "=$tname:"` on both the `set-option`/`set-window-option` lines (explicit
  window target); `cmd_start_all`'s `cmd_start "$name"` -> `cmd_start "$name"
  --detach`. Verified live: a fresh non-TTY `amux start <name>` now starts the
  session and prints the honest attach-failure message instead of silent exit 1;
  `amux start-all` against 8 fully-stopped sessions now starts all 8 in one pass
  (the 9th, `synthesia`, fails for a pre-existing unrelated reason — a macOS path
  baked into its config on this Linux box — and now says so clearly instead of the
  whole batch dying silently after the first session).

## An AF-66-style guard existed for this and had been green the whole time
AREA: instruments
SEVERITY: slows
STATUS: fixed
DATE: 2026-08-25
SESSION: amux
CARD: AMUX-3707
SYMPTOM: `assert_cli_verbs_exist` in board_drive.rs does exactly the check that
  would have caught the above, and was written for exactly this failure (AF-66,
  where `amux board show` fell through to help and exited 2). It is called on
  ONE prompt, from one fixture: the pickup Claim prompt. The decompose nudge
  never flowed through it, so a verb it named for months did not exist and the
  suite stayed green.
COST: No wrong conclusion shipped, but the guard's existence is what made the
  gap invisible. Anyone auditing "do we check that emitted commands exist?"
  finds the helper, reads it, and stops. Reading the check does not reveal which
  call sites it covers.
FIX: c1c238b1 widens it from one fixture to a source sweep of the whole server
  crate. The general lesson is ethos rule 7's: ask where the defect would be
  INTRODUCED and confirm the fixture flows through that code, not an ancestor of
  it. A single-call-site guard is worth naming its scope in its own doc comment.

FIX: `/home/syseng/src/amux/amux` (ships on save, already live): `-t "=$tname"` ->
  `-t "=$tname:"` on both the `set-option`/`set-window-option` lines (explicit
  window target); `cmd_start_all`'s `cmd_start "$name"` -> `cmd_start "$name"
  --detach`. Verified live: a fresh non-TTY `amux start <name>` now starts the
  session and prints the honest attach-failure message instead of silent exit 1;
  `amux start-all` against 8 fully-stopped sessions now starts all 8 in one pass
  (the 9th, `synthesia`, fails for a pre-existing unrelated reason — a macOS path
  baked into its config on this Linux box — and now says so clearly instead of the
  whole batch dying silently after the first session).

## A fix that brings the fleet back up can itself make local cargo unsafe again
AREA: build
SEVERITY: blocks
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-31
SESSION: amux
CARD: AMUX-48
SYMPTOM: Shortly after fixing AMUX-49 (every registered lane, not just `amux`,
  now comes back up after a reboot — 6 more Claude sessions went from stopped to
  running as a direct result), a plain `cargo check -p amux-server` — the ONE
  cargo invocation the existing offload-builds guidance called safe to run
  locally, single-crate, `.cargo/config.toml`'s `jobs=1`/`incremental=false`
  throttle already active — got OOM-killed (exit 137) anyway. `free -h`
  immediately after: 5.5GiB available out of 13GiB, zero swap. `.cargo/
  config.toml`'s own header (written 2026-08-28, FRONT-2) already names the
  mechanism: its throttle was tuned and verified against THAT day's baseline
  memory occupancy, and it explicitly warns a kill under pressure is not
  necessarily the build's own process — the OOM killer can reap an unrelated
  Claude Code session as collateral instead. AMUX-49 raised this box's
  baseline occupancy (8 running Claude processes instead of 2, ~200-400MB RSS
  each) without anyone re-measuring whether the existing throttle still holds
  against the new baseline.
COST: A gate that could not be honestly satisfied: AMUX-48's new invariants
  check (session.registered_lane_is_running) is written and follows an
  established, already-working pattern closely, but could not be verified to
  even COMPILE locally without risking re-crashing the same session AMUX-49
  had just recovered — the exact irony of one fix undermining the safety
  margin a sibling fix depended on. Remote build hosts were ALSO unreachable
  at the same time (a separate, unrelated baar-site netbird outage), so there
  was no fallback verification path at all for a period.
FIX: none yet — this is a structural gap, not a one-line bug. The honest
  interim mitigation (applied 2026-08-31): `offload-builds` memory widened to
  say `cargo check -p <single-crate>` is no longer a blanket-safe default —
  check `free -h` for real headroom before ANY local cargo invocation, treat
  the margin as a property of current fleet occupancy, not of the command's
  scope. A real fix would be either a durable local swap file (this box
  currently has NONE — `free -h` shows `Swap: 0B`, so there is zero graceful
  degradation under pressure and the OOM killer fires immediately) or a
  standing, always-available remote build target instead of relying on
  the specific remote hosts named in CLAUDE.local.md (private, this repo
  is public) being up when needed.

## Same root cause as above, escalated: the auto-builder itself now fails repeatedly, not just a manual check
AREA: build
SEVERITY: blocks
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-31
SESSION: amux
CARD: AMUX-48
SYMPTOM: Supersedes/extends "A fix that brings the fleet back up can itself
  make local cargo unsafe again" (same date, above) — that entry covered a
  manual `cargo check` getting OOM-killed once. Verifying AMUX-48's `done`
  card an hour later surfaced something worse: `amux-builder.timer`
  (enabled, polling every 60s) has been trying to build commit d7af60f5
  since it landed and failed SIX consecutive times over ~15 minutes, every
  attempt dying with a bare `Terminated` right after "Preparing worktree"
  finishes, before any `Compiling` line ever appears in the log. Host load
  climbed the whole time this was observed: 43.59 -> 58.08 (1-min, 4
  cores) — not a one-off spike, a sustained, worsening trend. The
  builder's own lock (mkdir-based, `scripts/rust-auto-build.sh`) IS working
  correctly — attempts are serialized, not overlapping — so this is not the
  builder compounding its own problem, it's the AMBIENT load (this
  session's 8 concurrent Claude processes + a desktop stack (Xvfb/x11vnc/
  openbox/chromium) that restarted mid-observation for unrelated reasons
  (see FRONT-4) + everything else on this box) leaving no room for even a
  single serialized release build to complete.
COST: `/health`'s `commit` field has been stuck at `5e5f4b24da71` through
  three real fix commits (e6d48d53, d428277a, d7af60f5) landing on top of
  it — the fleet has been running increasingly-stale code for the whole
  window, and AMUX-48's own invariants check (meant to catch OTHER
  processes dying silently) cannot itself be confirmed live because the
  binary that would contain it never finishes building. The exact
  "outcome confirmed to still hold" a `verified` gate asks for could not be
  honestly claimed for the live-deploy half of that question — recorded
  as a caveat on the card rather than papered over.
FIX: none yet. Same interim mitigation as the prior entry (offload,
  headroom-check before local cargo) doesn't cover THIS case — the builder
  is a system service, not something a session chooses to run or skip.
  A real fix needs either genuinely lowering this box's baseline occupancy
  (durable question: does this box need to run 8 concurrent Claude
  sessions plus a full desktop stack plus periodic release builds, or does
  one of those need to move), or giving the builder itself a remote-offload
  path the way this session now does manually for ad hoc verification.

## A local `cargo clippy` OOM-kill doesn't just kill the build — it kills the WHOLE interactive session
AREA: build
SEVERITY: blocks
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-09-01
SESSION: amux
CARD: AMUX-70
SYMPTOM: Ran `cargo clippy -p amux-server --all-targets` locally in this
  interactive pane as a fallback when the remote build host's toolchain
  image kept failing to rebuild (rustup uplink flakiness, already
  documented in CLAUDE.local.md — host details deliberately omitted here,
  this file is public). `clippy-driver` grew to ~2GB RSS and got OOM-killed
  (`dmesg -T`: 08:54:28 and 09:22:32). Confirmed via `journalctl --user`:
  every process in an interactive amux pane — including the Claude Code
  process itself — shares ONE systemd scope,
  `tmux-spawn-<uuid>.scope`. Systemd does not reap just the OOM-killed
  process: it marks the WHOLE SCOPE `Failed with result 'oom-kill'`
  (`tmux-spawn-006a872a....scope: Failed with result 'oom-kill' (3.7G
  memory peak)`), and whatever launches the pane tears it down and starts
  a brand-new one 26 seconds later (`Started tmux-spawn-baff1e65-...`).
  The entire interactive session restarted mid-conversation as a result —
  not the build process, the SESSION. Surfaced to the session only as
  orphaned background-task notifications ("stopped ... may have been
  stopped via agent teardown") — nothing points at OOM or the scope
  failure; that only came from reading `journalctl`/`dmesg` directly.
COST: This exact session lost an in-flight `git commit` (had to be
  re-run), an in-flight `cargo clippy` verification pass (had to restart
  from a fresh session with no memory of the interrupted state until the
  transcript resumed), and cost real wall-clock time diagnosing "why does
  amux keep stopping" as a SEPARATE investigation from the work that
  caused it. Anyone running local cargo/clippy/test/build directly in an
  interactive pane hits this identically.
FIX: none in code yet. Documented as a hard rule in this session's own
  `offload-builds` memory: never run cargo build/check/clippy/test
  directly in an interactive pane, even as a one-off fallback — that pane
  IS the session. If local is unavoidable, run it via `systemd-run --user
  --scope -- cargo ...` so the build gets its OWN scope, not the pane's.
  AMUX-70 filed for a durable fix (either that wrapper baked into the
  sanctioned local-build path, or making the remote-offload fallback
  actually reliable so this is never reached for).
## Typing at a lane disabled that lane's auto-pickup
AREA: board
SEVERITY: blocks
STATUS: fixed
DATE: 2026-08-26
SESSION: amux
CARD: AMUX-3757
SYMPTOM: Every prompt is auto-captured as a `doing` card whose desc is still literally `**Prompt:** <what was typed>`, and that card counted against the WIP-1 cap. An unanswered prompt is not work in progress — the decompose nudge exists precisely to make the lane dispose of it — but the pickup query could not tell the two apart. The exemption list already carried tripwire, watch, epic and needs:you for the same reason and had never been extended to the cards amux mints itself.
COST: The specimen is TUBES-2225, titled "Why are you stopping": Ethan's complaint about tubescience stopping was itself the card holding the WIP slot that kept it stopped. A frustrated re-prompt is the likeliest prompt to arrive at a stalled lane, so the loop closed on exactly the lanes already in trouble. This lane's own board held 11 capture shells in `doing` at once, all of them his prompts.
FIX: 7e4682f0 — a capture shell joins the WIP exemption, using the same `substr(desc,1,11)` form as the fold query in board.rs so the two cannot disagree about what a capture shell is. Reshaping the desc, which is the exit the decompose nudge already asks for, makes it count again.

## A latency card named an innocent endpoint with a verdict that was confidently backwards
AREA: instruments
SEVERITY: slows
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-26
SESSION: amux
CARD: AMUX-3772
SYMPTOM: A host-wide stall that RAMPS files a single-family outlier card on the scan where fewer than AMUX_OUTLIER_ROLLUP_AT (3) families have crossed the threshold. That card's verdict then says "This is not a percentile shift — it is individual requests going wrong, so look at the request, not the family", which is the exact opposite of the truth, and it names an endpoint that answered in 0.09s minutes later. The rollup that describes it correctly already exists and fires on every subsequent scan; nothing revisits the card filed at the leading edge.
COST: One lane-turn to diagnose, and the diagnosis only landed because `host_load_at_worst` was in the payload and I followed it. A reader who trusts the verdict audits innocent code. ethos.md rates a loud wrong probe worse than a silent one, and this is one: it answers, names a specific target, and is wrong.
FIX: none yet, deliberately. The obvious fix — suppress a single-family card when an open ROLLUP exists — is WRONG while a rollup card can sit parked in backlog indefinitely, because it would mute every genuine single-endpoint regression. That prerequisite is AMUX-3774 and is now fixed; this card is parked with that as its trigger. Recorded because building the wrong fix first is exactly what I did, and the order matters.

## Discarding an autofix card as a "duplicate" deletes the only thing suppressing the re-file
AREA: instruments
SEVERITY: annoys
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-28
SESSION: amux
CARD: AMUX-3849
SYMPTOM: A live outage (`/api/browser/start` 502) produced FOUR cards in three hours. I hand-filed AMUX-3842 with the diagnosis, then discarded the two autofix cards as duplicates of it, twice, and a fourth arrived anyway. `open_card_for_fault` suppresses on `source_ref LIKE 'autofix:<ident>|%'` for any card not done/verified/discarded — so a HAND-FILED card carries no signature and can never suppress, and discarding the autofix ones removes the only cards that could. The two look identical on the board: same title shape, same status vocabulary, no visible difference between a card the detector will honour and one it cannot see. `discarded` not suppressing is DELIBERATE and correct (it is what lets a genuinely new occurrence file after a judged one), so every individual piece behaved as designed while the composite guaranteed a re-file loop.
COST: Three discards, four cards, and the wrong conclusion available at every step — the obvious reading is "the dedupe is broken", which is what I would have reported if I had not gone and read `fault_identity`. The detector was right and I had deleted its memory. Also self-inflicted noise on a shared board while the underlying outage sat correctly parked in `needsyou`.
FIX: none yet. Immediate workaround, applied: copy the autofix signature onto the hand-filed card's `source_ref`, which makes it suppress (verified against the LIKE). Two candidate real fixes, cheapest first: (a) `amux board discard` warns when the card carries an autofix signature AND is the last non-terminal card holding that ident — a discard that turns the detector back on should say so; (b) `board add` for a fault already carded by autofix is the wrong move entirely and the honest path is folding the diagnosis INTO the autofix card, which nothing currently suggests. The transferable shape: a card's suppressing power lives in a field nobody looks at, so two cards that read identically to a human behave oppositely to the detector.

## "The tests pass" is load-dependent on this box, so a green suite is a weaker claim than it reads
AREA: tests
SEVERITY: slows
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-28
SESSION: amux
CARD: AMUX-3853
SYMPTOM: A full `cargo test -p amux-server --lib` run showed 8 failures, all in `opencode::structured`, in code nobody had touched. Re-run in isolation the same tests are 15 pass / 0 fail. The failures were build contention: those tests spawn a binary out of the shared `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` while another lane's build is rewriting it, which is the ETXTBSY family `2618b7d3` already added a retry for. The retry is not sufficient under the load this machine actually carries (50 lanes, a builder rebuilding on every commit, and any peer running clippy).
COST: I nearly reported 8 failures as a regression in a peer's area, and spent a cycle proving they were not. The larger cost is retrospective: every "1530 pass, 0 failed" I wrote on a card today rested on a run that happened not to contend, and I could not have told the difference at the time. A green suite here means "green, and nothing was building" — the second clause is invisible and nobody states it. That is the same shape as the 706ms latency number from the same day: a measurement taken on a machine whose load is the dominant variable, reported as if the load were not there.
FIX: none yet. The cheap instrument, not the cure: have the test run record whether a build was in flight (the builder's lock is already on disk at `~/.amux/rust-build.lock`) and print it beside the result, so a red suite says whether it was contended. The cure is either per-lane target dirs (rejected before, for disk) or serialising the spawn-a-binary tests behind the same lock the builder takes. Naming the instrument first because the wrong lesson from this entry is "ignore red suites", and a contention flag is what separates the two honestly.

## `git commit -a` in a shared checkout swept three lanes' in-flight work into one lane's commit, twice in four hours
AREA: attribution
SEVERITY: slows
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-30
SESSION: amux
CARD: AF-342
SYMPTOM: Mid-task on AMUX-3886 I had ~87 uncommitted lines in
 crates/amux-server/src/api/browser.rs (a `with_cause` helper plus 28 call sites).
 ts-gke committed 78009d90, "browser-reaper: add hard TTL to kill old browsers
 regardless of page state", touching the same file for an unrelated reason. All 87 of my
 lines went in with it. `git log -S with_cause --oneline` now answers with a commit about
 a TTL arm. I found out only because `git diff` on my own file came back a single hunk
 when I had made two, which is a coincidence of what I happened to check next.
COST: About 25 minutes: reconstructing what had moved, proving the sweep from
 `git log -S`, and then rebuilding a mine-only tree in a scratch worktree because the
 shared checkout by then held three lanes' in-flight edits and would not compile. The
 durable cost is the record: the fix for a browser 502 is filed under a browser-reaper
 TTL commit, and the next person to run `git log -S` or `git blame` on it gets a wrong
 answer with nothing marking it wrong. Not rewriting history over it — 172 unpushed
 commits with live lanes — so this entry and the follow-up commit body are the record.
SEVERITY-NOTE (appended same day, after the recurrence): raising this from `slows`.
 It happened AGAIN four hours later, same lane. 8a990ebd, "browser-reaper: activity arm",
 carries THREE lanes' work: my remaining AMUX-3886 change (+281 integrations/browser.rs,
 +59 api/browser.rs), amux-frustrations' entire AF-342 fix (+199 git_guard.rs, +100
 test-staged-guard-render.sh, the hook, checks.yml, their ledger entry), and ts-gke's own
 reaper arm. The second sweep landed AFTER ts-gke had read the diagnosis of the first,
 agreed with it in writing, and said they were adopting the explicit-paths guard. So this
 class does not require a careless session; it requires a lane that intends the right
 thing and reaches for a familiar verb.
 AND THE FIX FOR THIS WAS ONE OF THE THINGS SWEPT. amux-frustrations had AF-342 STAGED,
 holding the commit on a full-suite result, when someone else's commit took the index. A
 lane that stages early and verifies before committing is MORE exposed, not less, because
 its work sits in the shared index longer. That is the argument against every advisory
 guard on this path.
 ATTRIBUTION CORRECTION (same day, after ts-gke checked my evidence). I claimed above
 that both sweeps were the SAME LANE and leaned on "same Amux-Session AND same
 Amux-Conversation" as two agreeing signals. They are ONE signal. Read
 .git/hooks/prepare-commit-msg: `stamp="$AMUX_SESSION"`, then `conv` is a lookup of
 `~/.amux/sessions/$stamp.meta.json` for `cc_conversation_id`. The conversation field is
 DERIVED FROM the session field, so a wrong stamp produces a wrong conversation id
 identically and the commit reads as doubly confirmed. Everything reduces to one
 env var in whatever process ran `git commit`, and AMUX_SESSION is inherited by any
 child of a lane.
 So "two sweeps by one lane, the second after that lane agreed in writing" is NOT
 established, and I withdraw it. What survives: two sweeps happened, and the mechanism
 is `git commit -a` (established independently — my UNTRACKED test file was not taken
 while every modified TRACKED file was, which `git add -A` would not produce). The class
 argument does not need the actor to be identified, which is the useful part.
 Contrary evidence worth keeping: all three ts-gke-stamped commits carry
 `Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.6` while that lane runs opus-5, and `Claude-Session:
 session_01Gg7LPMY45VdVgrq29tHv2A` is on 78009d90 and 2a914717 but ABSENT from 8a990ebd
 — a field no amux hook writes. None of that is conclusive (the hook's own comment
 measures Claude-Session on ~30% of commits, so absence proves nothing), and that is the
 point: the record cannot answer who committed, in either direction.
 CARDED as AMUX-3916: the stamp needs one field the committing process cannot inherit.
 MECHANISM, narrower than the first entry had it. My untracked test file was NOT taken
 while every modified TRACKED file was: that is `git commit -a`, not `git add -A`. `-a`
 stages every modified tracked file at commit time — exactly the set a shared checkout
 fills with peers' work — and it never touches the index beforehand, so it walks straight
 past AF-316's staging refusal. The guard to state is "never pass -a", not "prefer
 explicit paths".
FIX: This is AF-342 (filed by amux-frustrations ~20 minutes before 78009d90 landed)
 seen from the other end, and it CORRECTS one clause of that entry. AF-342's COST says
 "The guard correctly kept the peer's two dirty browser.rs files OUT of the commit, so
 its load-bearing half worked." On the very next commit, on one of those same two files,
 it did not: the load-bearing half is exactly what failed here. Both observations are
 real — amux-frustrations was warned and stopped, ts-gke was not — which means the
 guard's protection is not a property of the guard, it is a property of whether the
 committing session happens to read 93 lines of warning it has learned to scroll past.
 That is the argument AF-342's own SYMPTOM makes ("warnings that fire on the normal path
 are the ones people learn to scroll past, which is how the peer-hunk case gets missed"),
 now with the case attached. ts-gke's diagnosis, unprompted and worth keeping: the
 property the guard needs is "this path has no edit record from the COMMITTING session",
 not "this path was edited via shell" — heredocs are one way to be invisible, and a
 codegen step, a `git checkout` and a peer's editor are three more. Scope AF-342's fix to
 the general property.

## A trustworthy test run on a contended file now requires a private worktree, and each one costs a full dependency rebuild
AREA: instruments
SEVERITY: slows
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-30
SESSION: amux-frustrations
CARD: AF-336
SYMPTOM: Verifying the AF-342 fix, `cargo test -p amux-server --lib git_guard` failed to
 compile for ~35 minutes on errors entirely inside a peer's in-flight
 crates/amux-server/src/api/browser.rs (E0308 tuple arity, then an unterminated json!
 macro) while three lanes edited the tree. `cargo test` builds the TREE, so a red result
 said nothing about my change and a green one would have been equally uninformative.
 Both amux and amux-frustrations independently reached for the same workaround in the
 same hour, neither having proposed it to the other: `git worktree add --detach <tmp>
 HEAD`, apply only your own diff, test there.
COST: ~35 minutes of blocked verification on this pass, plus a full dependency rebuild
 per worktree because CARGO_TARGET_DIR keys on the workspace path, so the shared build
 cache does not carry over. The durable cost is that the sanctioned verification command
 in VERIFY.md is now untrustworthy for any contended file, with nothing in its output
 saying so: scripts/test-contended.sh reports whether a BUILD was running, which is a
 different question from whether a peer's half-saved source is in your tree. Two lanes
 converging on an unshared workaround in one hour is the signal that it is the norm.
FIX: AF-336 (per-lane worktree) ends this class rather than detecting it, and this entry
 is evidence for it rather than a new proposal. Until then the cheap half is honesty in
 the instrument: have scripts/test-contended.sh report, beside its result, whether any
 tracked source in the crate under test is dirty and attributed to another session. A
 compile failure in a file you did not touch would then read as such instead of as your
 own regression.

## SUPERSEDES the entry above: the consumer guard EXISTED and was correct — `--lib` never ran it
AREA: instruments
SEVERITY: blocks
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-30
SESSION: amux-frustrations
CARD: AF-346
SYMPTOM: My entry above says the a99955f7 dashboard regression happened because no
 consumer-side invariant existed and that amux was adding one. Both halves are wrong, and
 amux established it by checking rather than agreeing with me.
 `tests/board_api.rs :: list_is_slim_by_default_and_serves_prose_only_on_request` already
 existed, drives the real HTTP list path, and asserts desc_head starts with the card's
 first line. Run against a99955f7 in a scratch worktree it fails in 0.16s. The guard was
 written before either of us got here, was right, and would have blocked the commit.
 It did not run because I verified with `cargo test -p amux-server --lib`, which reports
 "1625 passed" and SKIPS every `tests/*.rs` target: 47 integration files, ~339 tests.
COST: The regression itself is costed in the entry above. The cost of THIS entry is the
 wrong lesson I nearly left in the ledger: "add consumer-side tests" is useless advice
 when the consumer-side test is already written, and it would have sent the next reader
 to write a duplicate of a passing test instead of fixing the command that skipped it.
 A false mechanism filed as history is the thing archiving rules exist to prevent, and I
 was ten minutes from it.
FIX: amux put it in VERIFY.md by name — `--lib` is a partial run whose number reads like a
 total — and strengthened two assertions in that same test that were weaker than they
 looked: `desc_len.as_u64().is_some()` is TRUE of 0, so it and the log_n line beside it
 would BOTH have gone green against the blanked loader. Only desc_head had teeth. Now
 they assert `> 0`, mutation-checked, at cc3b4221. What remains open is the general shape:
 a suite-shaped command that silently covers a subset is the same instrument failure as a
 probe reporting zero when it never ran, and `--lib` is not the only such flag.

## The observed-edit record has no content hash, so "who edited this" is unfalsifiable by construction
AREA: attribution
SEVERITY: slows
STATUS: open
DATE: 2026-08-31
SESSION: amux-frustrations
CARD: AMUX-3954
SYMPTOM: The staged-guard named me as a co-editor of
 crates/amux-server/src/runtime_jobs/autofix.rs. Three timestamps break the claim:
   my observed record for that path   20:41:38
   the file's actual mtime            22:06:42   <- the bytes that were committed
   the mass `cargo fmt` sweep         22:10:14   (alerts.rs, auth.rs, ~180 files)
 My record is 85 minutes BEFORE the write whose content landed, and the file is 3.5
 minutes off the fmt sweep, so it was a third, separate write. The record is
 `<ts> <session> n=<count> paths=<names>` with no hash anywhere (confirmed in the writer
 by amux), so the guard compares a TIMESTAMP WINDOW against a file that moved, and any
 write to that path inside the window inherits whoever's window it was.
COST: Two mis-attributions by one lane in a single day. This one, and earlier amux told
 ts-gke their commit had absorbed 220 lines — the trailer evidence showed the commit was
 not even ts-gke's conversation. Different signal, same shape: a name with no way to test
 it. Each costs a round trip between two lanes to disprove, and the durable cost is worse
 than the minutes: a guard that names the wrong peer teaches lanes to discount it, which
 spends the credibility it needs for the cases where it is right. On this same day the
 SAME guard correctly stopped a real sweep, so both outcomes are live.
FIX: Hash each path at observation time and compare against the staged blob — match, name
 them; differ, drop the name and say why. That turns "someone touched this path recently"
 into "someone touched THIS CONTENT", which is the claim the warning already makes in
 prose. Tracked as AMUX-3954, deliberately NOT built at the end of a long session: it is a
 change to a safety-critical guard, which is how a fix becomes the next incident.
NOTE THE THIRD OUTCOME, because neither party had a slot for it: this was not "you were
 right" or "I was wrong". The signal was REAL and pointed at the WRONG EVENT. An
 attribution system keyed on time rather than content will keep producing that verdict,
 and the AF-179 caveat is doing real work — it is why amux hedged instead of asserting —
 but a caveat cannot make an unfalsifiable signal falsifiable.

## A test cell that reads the ambient process ancestry cannot fail on the box that wrote it
AREA: tests
SEVERITY: blocks
STATUS: fixed
DATE: 2026-08-31
SESSION: amux
CARD: AMUX-3962
SYMPTOM: `checks` red on main for the whole fleet, two consecutive runs. Failing step
 `test-commit-stamp.sh`, cells 1 and 2, `alpha='' beta=''` and `got ''`. Both cells ran
 the commit-msg hook under whatever process ancestry the test inherited and asserted on
 the `Amux-Agent` trailer, which the hook populates by walking its own parents for a
 `claude` process. On any dev box that walk finds the session running the test, so both
 cells pass. In CI there is no claude anywhere in the tree, the hook correctly omits the
 field, and both cells fail on an empty string. Reproduced locally by reparenting the
 test to init, which is what a runner looks like from inside the walk: 7 passed, 2 failed,
 same two cells, same empty values.
COST: About an hour of fleet-wide red CI, and the specific cost is that `checks` is the
 job every lane's `board done` evidence leans on, so a red there taxes work nobody
 involved was doing. Worse, it was invisible in the only place anyone was looking: two
 lanes independently ran the local suite that night and both read green (1665/0), because
 the local suite and the CI job were not running the same thing. The commits that went
 red were not the commits that broke it. The cells had NEVER been green in CI; run
 33396997200 was simply the first one to reach them, so the fleet-wide red landed on
 whoever happened to push next, four commits downstream of the author.
FIX: 232c212f. The two cells now build their own ancestry, the technique the later cells
 in the same file already used: one `claude` shim (a symlink, so ps sees a matching
 argv[0] basename), both hook runs under it, so ancestry is a test INPUT rather than a
 property of whoever launched the test. 9/9 with a claude ancestor and 9/9 reparented to
 init. Cell 2 got stronger on the way past: it asked `ps -p <pid>` for liveness, which
 cannot tell the right process from any live one. Mutating the hook to stamp `pid=1` is
 both invariant and live, and the old pair passed that completely clean; against the
 shim's known pid it fails.
THE SHAPE, which is the reusable part: a cell that reads the ambient environment measures
 the LAUNCHER, not the code. It is not merely untested in the other environment, it is
 structurally unable to fail in the one where it was written, so a local green carries no
 information about it at all. The tell is an assertion whose subject was not constructed
 by the test. That is ethos rule 7 with a location attached: "can your check actually
 fail" has to be asked about the environment as well as the logic, and the way to ask it
 is to run the file somewhere the ambient answer is absent.

## The staged-guard's blocked-commit remedy edits the other lane's staged work
AREA: attribution
SEVERITY: slows
STATUS: fixed
DATE: 2026-08-31
SESSION: amux (found the technique), amux-frustrations (filed and fixed)
CARD: AF-365
SYMPTOM: When the guard BLOCKS a commit over a peer's co-edited file, its only
  suggestion was `git restore --staged <their paths>`. On a shared index that
  mutates state belonging to the other lane: their file is staged because THEY
  staged it, and unstaging is an edit to someone else's in-flight work made by a
  party who cannot see what they intended. The near-miss that exposed it: amux had
  an unstaged `checks.yml` hunk at ~line 316 while my hunk in the SAME FILE was
  already staged at ~line 181.
COST: No damage, because amux found the exit themselves and said the guard does not
  suggest it. What the obvious path would have cost is worse than plain absorption:
  committing that file would have SPLIT my change, landing my CI wiring under their
  commit message while the app.js it wires stayed uncommitted, so my own commit
  would have wired nothing. Two lanes, one file, and every documented move was wrong.
  `git add -p`, which the guard recommends two screens down for the partial-stage
  case, is also the wrong tool here: the problem is not which of YOUR hunks to take,
  it is that THEIRS are already staged.
FIX: Fixed. `git commit <your paths>` is now offered FIRST, labelled as the exit
  that touches nothing the peer owns, and the unstage remedy now says out loud that
  it edits the shared index. A cell in test_amux_staged_guard.py pins both the
  presence and the ORDER, plus the stated reason, because an unexplained ordering
  gets tidied back by the next person who thinks restore reads better first.
  The cell reads the SHIPPED hook rather than executing the branch (that text is
  inline in main() and reaching it needs a multi-session git fixture), and it says
  so rather than implying parity with the cells above it.

## Editing a running .sh corrupts it mid-run, and the instrument cannot report its own death
AREA: instruments
SEVERITY: blocks
STATUS: fixed
DATE: 2026-08-31
SESSION: amux (hit it and diagnosed it), amux-frustrations (owns the file, took the fix)
CARD: AF-368
SYMPTOM: `amux` ran `scripts/test-contended.sh -p amux-server` and got:
    1888 passed, 0 failed, and NO `test result: FAILED` line anywhere
    no contention verdict printed at all
    ./scripts/test-contended.sh: line 53: syntax error near unexpected token `('
    exit 2
  Line 53 was a bare `#`, and the file was `bash -n` clean throughout. Two of my
  commits to that file landed inside their run. bash reads a script INCREMENTALLY,
  by byte offset, so the file growing underneath the running shell shifted the
  offsets and bash resumed mid-token, then failed on whatever byte now sat at its
  saved position — nowhere near either edit.
COST: Near-miss on a false red. Exit 2 with zero failures reads as a broken suite,
  and amux nearly reported it as one; what stopped them was noticing that "0 failed"
  and "exit 2" cannot both be a test result. They also correctly refused to report
  their own AMUX-3718 work green off that run, because its exit status described my
  edit rather than their code. This is the THIRD cause of a red suite after the
  builder and the dirty worktree, and it is the one this script structurally cannot
  report: it dies before reaching any echo, so its verdict is not wrong, it is
  ABSENT. The instrument's blind spot is the instrument.
FIX: Fixed. The wrapper now copies itself to a temp file and `exec`s that before
  doing anything else, so an edit cannot reach a run in flight. `exec` means one
  shell and the exit status still belongs to cargo. Snapshotting is the only fix at
  the right layer, because a report cannot describe a run that stopped existing.
  GENERALISES, and this is the part worth keeping: every .sh in this repo is
  exposed, and the bash CLI ships on SAVE, so `amux` itself is the largest instance
  — a long `amux` invocation running while any lane saves that file is this exact
  hazard. Not fixed here; that is a separate card.
  A NOTE ON THE TEST, because the first one lied. I wrote a behavioural cell that
  started the wrapper, truncated the file to garbage mid-run, and asserted it still
  exited 0. It passed. It also passed with the re-exec MUTATED AWAY, because bash
  buffers a file this small in a single read and the truncation never reached the
  running shell. A control that cannot fail is worse than none, so it was deleted
  rather than relabelled. The shipped cells assert the preamble exists, execs the
  snapshot, and has NO executable statement before it — position being the property
  that matters, since a snapshot taken after other work is a snapshot of a file that
  could already have moved. Both mutations now redden exactly one cell each.

## The staged-guard ships on INSTALL, so an edited hook is inert and nothing says so
AREA: instruments
SEVERITY: slows
STATUS: fixed
DATE: 2026-08-31
SESSION: amux-frustrations
CARD: AF-375
SYMPTOM: I shipped two changes to `scripts/git-hooks/amux-staged-guard` today and
  BOTH were inert. The hook is installed by COPY (`install-hooks.sh` cp's into
  `.git/hooks/`), so a repo edit reaches no lane until someone re-installs:
    grep -c 'COMMIT ONLY YOUR OWN PATHS'  installed=0  repo=1   (AF-365)
    grep -c '_orphan_deletions'           installed=0  repo=4   (AF-357)
  The installed copy was dated 09:34 and never moved. AF-365 was closed `done`
  with evidence reading "ALL PASS", which was TRUE and was about the repo copy.
  Nothing in the commit path, the test, or the card gate distinguishes "the file
  changed" from "the behaviour changed for anyone".
COST: One card closed on a false claim for about two hours, and a second fix that
  would have been closed the same way if I had not checked. The near-miss is the
  cost: I only looked because the day's own theme is "a fix ships, its tests pass,
  and it does nothing in production", so I asked the question out of habit rather
  than because anything prompted it. A lane without that habit closes both.
  This is NOT the same as the amux bash CLI, which ships on SAVE and is live
  immediately. Two hook-shaped files in one repo with opposite deploy semantics,
  and no signal at either site saying which you are editing.
FIX: The signal already exists and does not reach far enough. The SessionStart
  freshness hook DID report "installed git hooks differ from this checkout" at the
  start of this session, naming `prepare-commit-msg` and the remedy. I read it as
  boilerplate about a file I had not touched, and it was right. Two cheap
  improvements, either of which would have caught this:
  (1) name the differing hooks by FILE and flag when a differing file is one the
      CURRENT SESSION has edit records for, which turns a standing notice into a
      statement about your own work;
  (2) have the pre-commit hook itself compare its own bytes against
      `scripts/git-hooks/` and warn on drift, which is the same trick
      `install-hooks.sh` already does with `cmp` at the end of its run, moved to
      the place where it would be read.
  Not building either from here without deciding which; carded.
  SHIPPED: both halves. (2) is 4f668224. The post-commit hook compares its own
  bytes against scripts/git-hooks/ and warns on drift. (1) is df97f802. The
  SessionStart hooks-drift axis now crosses the drifting names against THIS
  session's observed-edit records and, on a hit, points at the falsifiable check
  (grep the INSTALLED copy, not the repo one), which is the sentence that would
  have caught AF-365. Its two negative cells are the load-bearing ones: another
  lane's record must not become your name, and a missing record must say the
  check did not run rather than reading as "none of these is yours".
  Self-signed is NOT available here: this lane both hit it and fixed it, so the
  entry stays until a lane that pays the cost confirms the notice reaches them.

## The freshness hook's `git merge origin/main` exits 2 in the exact state it prescribes it for
AREA: notices
SEVERITY: blocks
STATUS: fixed
DATE: 2026-09-01
SESSION: amux-frustrations (hit and fixed it), mixpeek-frustrations (paid part of the cost)
CARD: AF-385
SYMPTOM: SessionStart printed `RECONCILE IT: git merge origin/main (rewrites no
  SHAs; abort is clean)`. Running it: `error: Your local changes to the following
  files would be overwritten by merge: crates/amux-server/src/runtime_jobs/
  commit_nudge.rs / Please commit your changes or stash them before you merge. /
  Aborting`, exit 2. "abort is clean" describes `git merge --abort`, which never
  becomes reachable because the merge never begins. Git's own two suggestions are
  both forbidden on a shared checkout: committing a peer's file lands their work
  under your name, stashing it takes it out of their worktree while they are in
  it. No third option was named anywhere (ethos rule 3).
COST: The checkout stayed unreconciled through two lanes' attempts. mixpeek-
  frustrations applied and reverted a mutation in that file and deliberately
  restored to the state it FOUND rather than to HEAD, to protect work that turned
  out to need no protecting. This lane declined to merge for the same reason and
  spent the diagnosis. The blocking file was byte-identical to origin's copy the
  whole time (`diff <(git show 9b556907:<path>) <path>` -> exit 0, zero lines):
  ts-gke's TG-3343 work, already merged upstream, unstaged only because the
  checkout was behind. The safe reconcile was one comparison away and nothing
  said so.
FIX: e6b80033. The arm now names the files that block the merge and gives each a
  verdict, asymmetrically on purpose: byte-identical to upstream earns a printed
  discard command, because the bytes are recoverable from the remote; different
  earns no destructive command at all, because that is live work and mtime here
  names whoever was ACTIVE rather than whoever WROTE (AMUX-3662). Log signal:
  ~/.amux/reconcile-blocked.jsonl. The general shape, and the reason this is the
  SECOND instance in one day (AMUX-3718 was the first, archived the same
  morning): a notice that prescribes a procedure must be checked against the
  state it fires in, because the state that triggers it is exactly the state
  where the obvious command stops working. `drop_paths_identical_to_origin()`
  already computed this comparison for the idle nudge; the surface every lane
  reads at SessionStart did not (ethos rule 1).
